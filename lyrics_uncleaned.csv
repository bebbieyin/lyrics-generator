no role models and i'm here right now
no role models to speak of
searchin' through my memory, my memory, i couldn't find one
last night i was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
not trina but i swear to god, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
and tell her, ""hey, what's good?
sorry i'm never comin' home, i'ma stay for good.""
then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
i came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
ain't got no shame 'bout it
she think i'm spoiled and i'm rich 'cause i can have any bitch
i got defensive and said, ""nah, i was the same without it.""
but then i thought back, back to a better me
before i was a b-list celebrity
'fore i started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

i cannot complain, i cannot
i don't even know how much i really made, i forgot, it's a lot
fuck that, never mind what i got
nigga don't watch that 'cause i—
came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
no help, that's all me, all me for real
came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

[verse 3: big sean]
ho, shut the fuck up!
i got way too much on my mental
i learn from what i've been through
i'm finna do what i didn't do
and still waking up like the rent's due
not complicated, it's simple
i got sexy ladies, a whole benz-full
and to them hoes i'm everything—everything but gentle
but i still take my time (time)
man, i guess i'm just old fashioned
wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
nigga, see what i'm saying, no closed caption
i paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
i plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
my new girl is on glee and shit
probably making more money than me and shit
i swear to god i got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
i got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
like i got trust issues
i'm sorry for the people i've pushed out
i'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
and still gotta pull out
but that's just me and i ain't perfect
i ain't a saint but i am worth it
if it's one thing, i am worth it
niggas still hating but it ain't working
lil' bitch...

oh me, oh me, oh my

so i'm never gonna get too close to you
even when i mean the most to you
in case you go and leave me in the dirt

but every time you hurt me, the less that i cry
and every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
and every time you walk out, the less i love you

7 Years,Lukas Graham,pop,"

once i was seven years old my momma told me
go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
once i was seven years old

[verse 1]
it was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
by eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

[chorus 2]
once i was 11 years old my daddy told me
go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
once i was 11 years old

[verse 2]
i always had that dream like my daddy before me
so i started writing songs, i started writing stories
something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
cause only those i really love will ever really know me

[chorus 3]
once i was 20 years old, my story got told
before the morning sun, when life was lonely
once i was 20 years old

(lukas graham!!!)

[verse 3]
i only see my goals, i don't believe in failure
cause i know the smallest voices, they can make it major
i got my boys with me at least those in favor
and if we don't meet before i leave, i hope i'll see you later

[chorus 4]
once i was 20 years old, my story got told
i was writing 'bout everything, i saw before me
once i was 20 years old
soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
we've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
soon we'll be 30 years old

[verse 4]
i'm still learning about life
my woman brought children for me
so i can sing them all my songs
and i can tell them stories
most of my boys are with me
some are still out seeking glory
and some i had to leave behind
my brother i'm still sorry

[bridge]
soon i'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
remember life and then your life becomes a better one
i made a man so happy when i wrote a letter once
i hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

soon i'll be 60 years old, will i think the world is cold
or will i have a lot of children who can warm me
soon i'll be 60 years old

Castle on the Hill,Ed Sheeran,pop,"

when i was six years old i broke my leg
i was running from my brother and his friends
and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass i rolled down
i was younger then, take me back to when i

[pre-chorus]
found my heart and broke it here
made friends and lost them through the years
and i've not seen the roaring fields in so long, i know i've grown
but i can't wait to go home

i'm on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to ""tiny dancer""
and i miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[verse 2]
fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night, i don't reckon that i did it right
but i was younger then, take me back to when

[pre-chorus]
we found weekend jobs, when we got paid
we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
but i can't wait to go home

[chorus]
i'm on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to ""tiny dancer""
and i miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

over the castle on the hill

one friend left to sell clothes
one works down by the coast
one had two kids but lives alone
one's brother overdosed
one's already on his second wife
one's just barely getting by
but these people raised me
and i can't wait to go home

[chorus]
and i'm on my way, i still remember
these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way you make me feel, it's real

got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
and i pay my mama bills, i ain't got no time to chill
think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

[chorus]
said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
these expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
hit the store, i can get 'em both, i don't wanna choose
and i'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
i don't dance now, i make money moves
say i don't gotta dance, i make money moves
if i see you and i don't speak, that means i don't fuck with you
i'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, i make bloody moves

[verse 2]
if you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
and i just checked my accounts, turns out, i'm rich, i'm rich, i'm rich
i put my hand above my hip, i bet you dip, he dip, she dip
i say i get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
my pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
i just arrive in a rolls, i just came up in a wraith
i need to fill up the tank, no, i need to fill up the safe
i need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
i go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
i used to live in the p's, now it's a crib with a gate
rollie got charms, look like frosted flakes
had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
i just run and check the mail, another check from mona scott

said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to

to get away from your parents

while i'm wasted with someone else?”

but when it comes you close your window
you hate the fighting in the world
so you bring the battle home and fight until it's yours
fight until i'm gone

The Monster,Eminem,pop,"

[intro: rihanna]
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy

[verse 1: eminem]
i wanted the fame but not the cover of newsweek
oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
for wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew, see, but it was confusing
'cause all i wanted to do's be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink, used it as a tool when i blew steam
whoo! hit the lottery, ooh-wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winnin' a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm gettin' so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
goin' coo-coo and kooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause i'm—

[chorus: rihanna & (bebe rexha)]
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[verse 2: eminem]
now, i ain't much of a poet
but i know somebody once told me to seize the moment
and don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
could be over tomorrow, so i keep conjurin'
sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
no wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! i think it went wanderin' off down yonder
and stumbled onto jeff vanvonderen
'cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
'cause the very thing that i love's killin' me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
nobody's home, i'm sleepwalkin'
i'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
don't shoot the messenger, i'm just friends with the—

[verse 3: eminem]
call me crazy, but i have this vision, one day that
i'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then, drums get killed and
i'm comin' straight at mc's, blood gets spilled and
i'll take you back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
and shit to say back to the kids who played him
i ain't here to save the fuckin' children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
it's payback, russell wilson fallin' way back
in the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
straw into gold, chump, i will spin—rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket
face facts: i am nuts for real, but i'm okay with that!
it's nothin', i'm still friends with the—

i remember talking and drinking what we could find
burnin' all those candles and stayin' up through the night
we'd make reservations for the places we know we'd never try
but then oh, we found some rich love

i didn't move to the city to count all my pennies
and worship the hollywood sign
she'll say, ""hey man, nice to meet you,""
and she'll take every one last time
and i know, 'cause i found some fake love

ooh, but drink with you all damn night

we would piss off the neighbors
they'd eventually call the cops

Stressed Out,Twenty One Pilots,pop,"

[verse 1]
i wish i found some better sounds no one's ever heard
i wish i had a better voice that sang some better words
i wish i found some chords in an order that is new
i wish i didn't have to rhyme every time i sang
i was told, when i get older, all my fears would shrink
but now i'm insecure, an' i care what people think

[pre-chorus]
my name's blurryface and i care what you think
my name's blurryface and i care what you think

when our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

[verse 2]
sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when i was young
how come i'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
i'd make a candle out of it, if i ever found it
try to sell it, never sell out of it, i'd probably only sell one
it'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
but it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

[pre-chorus]
my-my-my name's blurryface and i care what you think
my name's blurryface and i care what you think

we used to play pretend, give each other different names
we would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
sayin', ""wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah

Don't,Ed Sheeran,pop,"

[verse 1]
i met this girl late last year
she said, ""don't you worry if i disappear""
i told her i'm not really looking for another mistake
i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jumped right in a week later, returned
i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me, ""i was never looking for a friend
maybe you could swing by my room around ten
baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
we'll be in between the sheets till the late am""
baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

[chorus]
don't fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe

[verse 2]
and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her
we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
before a text message was the only way to reach her
now she's staying at my place and loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha, all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep, i guess that i don't want to either
but me and her, we make money the same way
four cities, two planes, the same day
and those shows have never been what it's about
but maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
i'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
but we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
wish i'd have written it down, the way that things played out
when she was kissing him, how i was confused about
now she should figure it out, while i'm sat here singing

[chorus]
don't fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe

[verse 3]
(knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
i don't even know if she knows what for
she was crying on my shoulder, i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next (you bastard)
but you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
and i never saw him as a threat (you bastard)
until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
it's not like we were both on tour
we were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun, and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realised what you wanted
it's a bit too much, too late if i'm honest
and all this time, god knows i'm singing

[chorus]
don't fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe

You Had Me from Hello,Kenny Chesney,country,"

one word, that's all you said
something in your voice called me, turned my head
your smile, just captured me
you were in my future as far as i could see
and i don’t know how it happens, but it happens still
you asked me if i love you, if i always will

the moment i looked into your eyes you won me
it was over from the start you completely stole my heart
and now you won't let go
i never even had a chance you know
you had me from hello

[verse 2]
inside i built a wall
so high around my heart, i thought i'd never fall
one touch, you brought it down
the bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground
and i swore to me i wasn't going to love again
the last time was the last time i'd let someone in

but you had me from hello

friends don't call you in the middle of the night
couldn't even tell you why

friends don't stand around, playing with their keys

take the long way home (home)
get a little too close (close)
we do but, but friends don't

Reload (feat. Taylor Ray Holbrook),Colt Ford,country,"

don't take my kindness for weakness, oh no
don't take my silence for ignorance, oh no
so if you're into steppin' over lines, stompin' on my way of life
there's two things you need to know
we don't retreat, we reload

[verse 1: colt ford]
always into givin' a helpin' hand, but never take a handout
shakin' hands to sign a deal, that's what we're still about
keep sweat on our brow and dirt on our plow
in hopes for makin' a future for the ones that we care about
it's a tradition, passed down like hand-me-down jeans with stitches
that humble background is rollin' through our system, flowin' like a river
bred to be a hero and never play the victim
never start nothin', but we will finish it
so don't be so quick to run your lips
'cause you could get slapped by the same hand that i woulda helped you with
somebody tell 'em

don't take my kindness for weakness, oh no
don't take my silence for ignorance, oh no
so if you're into steppin' over lines, stompin' on my way of life

[verse 2: colt ford]
a lot of times we don't speak, we just listen
silence is a virtue, try it and find out what you been missin'
although we keep our distance, i peek over the fence
and think the world needs a little john wayne in it
respect is earned, we say ma'am and sir
salute those who served, 'cause it's well deserved
the first to call you out if you're lyin'
but the last to kick ya out if you're tryin'
we're the worst folks to those who kick us when we're down
but the best to those who've always been around
friends for life, trespassers get shot once
survivors shot twice

Hurt,Johnny Cash,country,"

[produced by rick rubin]

[verse 1]
i hurt myself today
to see if i still feel
i focus on the pain
the only thing that's real
the needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away
but i remember everything

what have i become
my sweetest friend?
everyone i know
goes away in the end
and you could have it all
my empire of dirt
i will let you down
i will make you hurt

i wear this crown of thorns
upon my liar's chair
full of broken thoughts
i cannot repair
beneath the stains of time
the feelings disappear
you are someone else
i am still right here

Check Yes Or No,George Strait,country,"

it started way back in third grade
i used to sit beside emmylou hayes
a pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail
she kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell

[verse 2]
next day i chased her 'round the playground
across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
and emmylou got caught passing me a note
before the teacher took it, i read what she wrote

[chorus]
""do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
and if you do
well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
if you want to
i think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

now we're grown up and she's my wife
still like two kids with stars in our eyes
ain't much changed, i still chase emmylou
up and down the hall, around the bed in our room

last night i took her out in a white limousine
twenty years together, she still gets to me
can't believe it's been that long ago
when we got started with just a little note

The House That Built Me,Miranda Lambert,country,"

i know they say ""you can’t go home again""
i just had to come back one last time
ma'am, i know you don't know me from adam
but these hand prints on the front steps are mine
up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
is where i did my homework and i learned to play guitar
and i bet you didn't know under that live oak
my favorite dog is buried in the yard

[chorus]
i thought if i could touch this place or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healing
out here it’s like i'm someone else
i thought that maybe i could find myself
if i could just come in, i swear i'll leave
won't take nothing but a memory
from the house that built me

[verse 2]
mama cut out pictures of houses for years
from 'better homes and garden' magazine
plans were drawn and concrete poured
nail by nail and board by board
daddy gave life to mama's dream

this brokenness inside me might start healing

it always looks the same
true love always does
here by your side or a million miles away
nothin' is ever gonna change the way i feel
the way it is, is the way that it was

when i said i do, i meant that i will
til' the end of all time
be faithful and true, devoted to you

for all who came before
and it goes hand in hand

only you and i can undo
all that we became
that makes us so much more (so much more)
than a woman and a man

after everything
that comes and goes around
has only passed us by
here alone in our dreams

i know there's a lonely heart
in every lost and found
but forever you and i will be the ones
who found out what forever means

truer than true
you know that i'll always be there for you

that's what i had in mind

we were all down at margie's bar
telling stories if we had one

from the pain the song was inflicting
and all at once he jumped to his feet
just like somebody kicked him

said it played a sad song it made him cry
went to his truck and got a forty five

so we did not draw an easy breath
until he laid that colt on the table
he hung his head till the cops showed up
they dragged him right out of margie's
told him ""don't you play dumb with us, son""
""know damn well what the charge is.""

said it played a sad song it made him cry
went to his truck and got a forty five

well, the sheriff arrived with his bathrobe on
the confrontation was a tense one
shook his head and said, ""bubba boy,""
""you was always a dense one.""
reckless discharge of a gun
that's what the officers are claiming
bubba hollered, ""reckless! hell!""
""i hit just where i was aiming.""

bubba shot the juke box last night
said it played a sad song it made him cry
went to his truck and got a forty five

through the teardrops in his eyes
beyond a shadow of a doubt
it was justifiable homicide

i start thinking that we're looking, we're looking at goodbye
how about a strong shot of honesty?
don't you owe that to me?

That Lonesome Song,Jamey Johnson,country,"

that mornin' sun made it's way
through the windshield of my chevrolet
whiskey eyes and ashtray breath
on a chert rock gravel road

[verse 1]
what the hell did i do last night?
that's the story of my life
like tryin' to remember words
to a song nobody wrote

[chorus]
and it's sad and it's long and can't nobody sing along
it's a southbound train, it's a whistle in the wind
ain't no one there to care where i've been
i'm hummin' on that lonesome song again

[verse 2]
i took a trip across the country from montgomery
discovered i'd been wrong for so long
i thought it was the fame and the glory and the money
but all i've got to show is a damn song

Good Directions,Billy Currington,country,"

[verse 1]
i was sitting there, selling turnips on a flatbed truck
crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
she had to be thinking, ""this is where rednecks come from""
she had hollywood written on her license plate
she was lost and looking for the interstate
needing directions, and i was the man for the job

[chorus]
i told her, way up yonder past the caution light
there's a little country store with an old coke sign
you got to stop in and ask miss bell for some of her sweet tea
then a left will take you to the interstate
but a right will bring you right back here to me

[verse 2]
i was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
kicking myself for not catching her name
i threw my hat, and thought, you fool, it could have been love
i knew my old ford couldn't run her down
she probably didn't like me anyhow
so i watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

[chorus]
i told her, way up yonder past the caution light
there's a little country store with an old coke sign
you got to stop in and ask miss bell for some of her sweet tea
then a left will take you to the interstate

is this georgia heat playing tricks on me?
or am i really seeing what i think i see?
the woman of my dreams coming back to me

don't know why, but something felt right
when she stopped in and asked miss bell
for some of her sweet tea
mama gave her a big old glass
and sent her right back here to me

where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies
who are praying they'll get out of here alive

talking about my earrings and my hair
i guess he ain't read the signs that say that i been to prison
someone ought to warn him before i knock him off his chair

because my longhair just can't cover up my red neck
i've won every fight i've ever fought
hey, i don't need some turkey telling me that i ain't country
and saying i ain't worth the damned old ticket that he bought

because i can sing all them songs about texas
and i still do all the sad ones that i know
they tell me, i look like merle haggard
and sound a lot like david allan coe

and the bar maid in the last town that we played in
knew the words to every song i'd wrote
she said jimmy rabbit turned her on to my last album
just about the time the jukebox broke

yeah, johnny cash helped me get out of prison
long before rodriguez stole that goat
i've been the rhinestone cowboy for so long i can't remember
and i can do you every song hank williams ever wrote

and i can sing all them songs about texas
and i still do all the sad ones that i know
i can't help it, i look like merle haggard
and i sound a lot like david allan coe

but the country deejays, all think i'm an outlaw

lookin' for some other way to fly

and sleep right through the calm before the storm

with my newfound sobriety, i've got the time to sit and think
of all the things i had, and threw away
this prison is much colder than
that one that i was locked up in just yesterday

leanin' pourin' coke and whiskey
told her about my condition

i'm up so high, i may never come down
i'll try anything to drown out the pain
they all know why i'm getting drunk on a plane

so i can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
and when we land i'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass

going to put the the world away for a minute
pretend i don't live in it
sunshine going to wash my blues away
had sweet love but i lost it
she got too close so i fought her
now i'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

wishing i was knee deep in the water somewhere
got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
never been so happy
never felt so high
and i think i might have found me my own kind of paradise

[verse 2: jimmy buffett]
wrote a note said be back in a minute
bought a boat and i sailed off in it
don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
mind on a permanent vacation
the ocean is my only medication
wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away

now i'm knee deep in the water somewhere
got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair

and i think i might have found me my own kind of paradise

Leave Me Alone,Tyler Braden,country,"

and thinking about calling her up
just give me time to come to my sense

i promise, babe, i’ll forget
how she done me wrong for so long
but, girl, don't come over yet

and just leave, leave me alone
why can't you see that i can’t move on?
'cause i see her face in yours
and i hear her voice any time you talk
her lips on the glass of the drink you're drinking
and her hips in the way you walk
so leave me alone

i know our eyes have met from afar
in this bar before
be there up in line to buy her a drink
or out there on the dance floor

but i ain't heard a word you've been saying
i'm talking to a memory

i bought a coke and some gasoline
and i drove out to the county fair

she was standing there in the ticket line
and it all started right then and there
oh, a sailor’s sky made a perfect sunset
and that's the day i'll never forget

i had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
she was killing me in that miniskirt
skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
she had a suntan line and red lipstick
i worked so hard for that first kiss
and a heart don't forget something like that

well it was five years later on a southbound plane
i was headed down to new orleans
to meet some friends of mine for mardi gras
when i heard a voice from the past
coming from a few rows back
and when i looked, i couldn't believe just what i saw
she said i bet you don't remember me
and i said only every other memory

it's hard to keep my hands on the wheel when she's looking so fine
i ride down any back road that she wants me to drive
with the

fingers through my hair
watching miles go by
like she just don't care
looking at me with
one thing on her mind

woah

i guess i'm making all the right wrong turns tonight

something about the sound of the gravel setting the mood
is got me thinking i should park this thing underneath the moon
and wrap ourselves all around each other like a vine of kudzu

as you're looking out the window when you board a train
when you take a sip, do you say my name?
when you get lost on the silver coast
will you stop for a minute and dance with my ghost?
in the flowers on the streets of rome
do you catch a scent of my cologne?
just when i think you might wanna come back home

[chorus]
there's no stopping you
'cause your mind's set to
where your heart says ""go""
go on, go girl, go
hope you find me in a stranger's smile
hope you hear me in the lonely miles
you gotta do what you were born to do
'cause there's no stopping you

[bridge]
sometimes i see you
when no one's there
and the wind blows through
your golden hair
whiskey burn
and the records spin
i pray that you'll come back again
but until then
until then

[chorus]
there's no stopping you
'cause your mind's set to
where your heart says ""go""
go on, go girl, go
hope you find me in a stranger's smile
hope you hear me in the lonely miles

'cause there's no stopping you

Sway,Danielle Bradbery,country,"

[verse 1]
hey, we're all in the same boat
life can really suck sometimes
but hey, can't live in a shadow
so here's a little piece of advice

[pre-chorus]
start by kicking off your shoes, leave 'em right by the door
then you call a couple friends and you call a few more
put a drink into your glass that will make you let go
then you find something smooth on the radio

[chorus]
that makes you wanna sway to the left and sway to the right
get lost in a groove that'll make you lose your mind
put a smile on your face, sends you right into a daze
no there ain't nothin' wrong when a song comes on
that makes you wanna sway, eh-eh-hey, eh-eh-hey, oh-oh-ooh

hey, world's kinda messed up
we got no time for sittin' around
waitin' for it to let up
let's break some rules and figure it out

put some tears on the tulips and the creation was bright

there's a girl somewhere in tupelo

who's talking with a southern drawl

why would we drive 600 miles one way?
blow through cash that we ain't made?
get tattoos and wash our trucks?
push and press our luck?
why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
show our hands and change our plans?
lose our minds, break our hearts?
and learn to play guitar?
why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?
cause there's a girl
cause there's a girl

you know a call it just won't do

Country Club,Travis Tritt,country,"

i took a double take out on the interstate
when i saw her makin' eyes at me
so i followed her down to clubhouse drive
past the pool and the 18th green
and in the parkin' lot i said,  it's mighty hot
maybe i could buy you a beer
she said, ""i'm glad you asked, but i'll have to pass
cause only members are allowed in here ... and i said

i'm a member of a country club
country music is what i love
i drive an old ford pick-up truck
i do my drink-in from a dixie cup
yea i'm a bona-fide dancin' fool
i shoot a mighty mean game of pool
at any honky-tonk or roadside pub
i'm a member of a country club""

you look so invitin'...thought it might be excitin'
for a woman with a limousine
to go bouncin around in a beat up truck
with a man in wore out jeans

i ain't nothin' but a simple man
they call me a redneck i reckon that i am
but there's things goin' on that make me mad down to the core
i have to work like a dog to make ends meet
there's crooked politicians and crime in the street
and i'm madder than hell, and i ain't a-gonna take it no more

we tell our kids ""just say no""
and then some panty-waist judge lets a drug dealer go
slaps him on the wrist and he turns him back out on the town

take a big tall tree and a short piece of rope
i'd hang 'em up high and let them swing 'til the sun goes down

now i'm the kinda man who wouldn'tt harm a mouse
but if i catch somebody breakin' in my house
i got twelve gauge shotgun waitin' on the other side

i don't want to have to fight you but i dern sure will
if you don't want trouble then you'd better just pass me on by

as far as i'm concerned there ain't no excuse
for the rapin' and the killin' and the child abuse

you just take them rascals out in the swamp
put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump

A Little Bit Stronger,Sara Evans,country,"

[intro]
woke up late today and i still feel the sting of the pain
but i brushed my teeth anyway
i got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face
i got a little bit stronger

[verse 1]
riding in the car to work and i'm
trying to ignore the hurt so i
turned on the radio
stupid song made me think of you
i listened to it for minute
but then i changed it
i'm getting a little bit stronger
just a little bit stronger

[chorus]
and i'm done hoping
that we could work it out
i'm done with how it feels
spinning my wheels
letting you drag my heart around
and, oh, i'm done thinking
you could ever change
i know my heart will never be the same
but i'm telling myself i'll be okay
even on my weakest days
i get a little bit stronger

[verse 2]
it doesn't happen overnight but you
turn around and a month's gone by
and you realize you haven't cried
i'm not giving you a hour or a second or another minute longer
i'm busy getting stronger

and i'm done hoping
that we could work it out
i'm done with how it feels

then he'll walk her down the aisle
and he'll raise her veil
but right now she up and crying
and the truth is that he do not mind
as he kisses her good night
and she says her prayers
he lays down there beside her
till her eyes are finally closed
and just watching her it breaks his heart
cause he already knows

it won't be like this for long
one day soon that little girl is going to be
all grown up and gone

who broke a window last week

sing along as the choir sways
every verse of amazing grace
and then we shake the preacher's hand
go home, into your blue jeans
have some chicken and some baked beans
pick a backyard football team
not do much of anything
that's what i love about sunday

i stroll to the end of the drive, pick up the sunday times
grab a coffee cup
it looks like sally and ron, finally tied the knot
well, it's about time

you curled up next to me

take a walk down a back road
tackle box and a cane pole
carve our names in that white oak
and steal a kiss as the sun fades

well, i walk into the room
passing out hundred dollar bills
and it kills and it thrills like the horns on my silverado grill
and i buy the bar a double round of  crown
and everybody's getting down
an' this town ain't never gonna be the same

[chorus:]
cause i saddle up my horse
and i ride into the city
i make a lot of noise
cause the girls
they are so pretty
riding up and down broadway
on my old stud leroy
and the girls say
save a horse, ride a cowboy
everybody says
save a horse, ride a cowboy

well i don't give a dang about nothing
i'm singing and bling-blinging
while the girls are drinking
long necks down!
and i wouldn't trade ol' leroy
or my chevrolet for your escalade
or your freak parade
i'm the only john wayne left in this town

and i saddle up my horse
and i ride into the city
i make a lot of noise
cause the girls
they are so pretty
riding up and down broadway
on my old stud leroy
and the girls say
save a horse, ride a cowboy
everybody says
save a horse, ride a cowboy

[spoken:]
i'm a thourough-bred
that's what she said
in the back of my truck bed
as i was gettin' buzzed on suds
out on some back country road
we where flying high
fine as wine, having ourselves a big and rich time
and i was going, just about as far as she'd let me go

but her evaluation
of my cowboy reputation
had me begging for salvation
all night long
so i took her out giggin frogs
introduced her to my old bird dog
and sang her every wilie nelson song i could think of
and we made love

and i saddled up my horse
and i ride into the city
i make a lot of noise
cause the girls
they are so pretty
riding up and down broadway
on my old stud leroy
and the girls say
save a horse, ride a cowboy
everybody says
save a horse, ride a cowboy

what? what?
save a horse ride a cowboy

"Last Thing I Needed, First Thing This Morning",Chris Stapleton,country,"

[verse 1]
the postman delivered, a ""past due"" bill notice
the alarm clock rang two hours late
the garbage man left all the trash on the sidewalk
and the hinges fell off of the gate
and this morning at breakfast, i spilled all the coffee
and opened the door on my knee

[refrain]
oh, the last thing i needed, the first thing this morning
was to have you walk out on me

[verse 2]
last night you came home late, and i knew you'd been drinking
by that old mellow look on your face
and i thought, ""it don't matter, 'cause it's the holiday season""
and you fill such a big empty space
and i laid down beside you, and i wanted your loving
'cause your love makes my life complete

[refrain]
oh, the last thing i needed, the first thing this morning
was to have you walk out on me

[verse 3]
so excuse me for looking, like my world just ended
and excuse me for looking, like i just lost my best friend
and excuse me for loving, and being forgiving
so just go on if you want to be free

she stole my heart and i started walking down a new road

it's like peace on earth
where time stands still

on a park bench down on 4th street
that's where i popped the question
and to my amazement she actually said yes
and tears filled my eyes as i slipped that ring on her hand
and then a few short years later god put into my world
a 6 pound and 8 ounce sweet baby girl
and ever since that day let me tell you know
i became a brand new man... because

and the mississippi river, she's a-goin' dry

i can plow a field all day long
i can catch catfish from dusk 'til dawn

we grow good ol' tomatoes and homemade wine
and a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

and we say grace and we say ma'am
if you ain't into that we don't give a damn

and the rocky mountains and the western skies
and we can skin a buck, we can run a trotline

he never called me by my name, just ""hillbilly""
my grandpa taught me how to live off the land
and his taught him to be a businessman
he used to send me pictures of the broadway nights
and i'd send him some homemade wine
but he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
for 43 dollars my friend lost his life
i'd love to spit some beech-nut in that dude's eyes
and shoot him with my old .45

Nothing On But The Radio,Gary Allan,country,"

i sure do hope this is a long night
cause i have never felt one so right
each look into your eyes, i'm falling
a little more and more

looks like we started us a fire
wrapped up in flames of desire
with every touch, they're burning higher
two shadows dancing on the wall

with nothing on but the radio
feel the music playing soft and slow
you and me and the lights down low
with nothing on but the radio

we'll fall asleep here in the moonlight
in tangled sheets, we'll be here all night
and when we wake up in the morning
we might stay like this all day

two people meant to be together
two lovers dreaming of forever
and it just keeps on getting better
with every tender little kiss

nothing on but the radio
feel the music playing soft and slow
you and me and the lights down low
with nothing on but the radio

two people meant to be together
two lovers dreaming of forever
and it just keeps on getting better
with nothing on but the radio
feel the music playing soft and slow

Love Wins,Love and Theft,country,"

when someone's all alone and standing on the edge
somebody reaches out and pulls 'em in
love wins
when someone's running out of places they can run
ashamed of their mistakes and things they've done
when someone opens up a door with open arms says come on in
love wins
love is patient, love is kind
love don't care who's wrong or right
doesn't envy, doesn't boast, it doesn't quit
it's not selfish, it's not proud
love's the noise above the loud
it never fails, it forgets and it forgives
love wins
when a husband leaves the house and slams the door
hears her say that she don't love him anymore
but after twenty years together they thank god they tried again
love wins
love is patient, love is kind
love don't care who's wrong or right
it doesn't envy, it doesn't boast, it doesn't quit
it's not selfish, it's not proud
love's the noise above the loud
it never fails, it forgets and it forgives
love wins
when we don't have to teach our kids
that beauty's deeper than the skin
and peace on earth is more than just a wish
when we let each other pray
in our own different ways
we'll bow our heads and open up our fists
love wins
love wins
love is patient, love is kind
love don't care who's wrong or right
doesn't envy, doesn't boast, it never quits

than lovin' a man who didn’t know
what he had when he had it
and i see the permanent damage you did to me
never again, i just wish i could forget when it was magic
i wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror
saying to myself, you know you had to do it
i know the bravest thing i ever did was run

[chorus]
sometimes, in the middle of the night, i can feel you again
but i just miss you, and i just wish you were a better man
and i know why we had to say goodbye
like the back of my hand
and i just miss you, and i just wish you were a better man
a better man

[verse 2]
i know i’m probably better off all alone
than needing a man who could change his mind
at any given minute
and it’s always on your terms
i’m hanging on every careless word
hoping it might turn sweet again
like it was in the beginning
but your jealousy, i can hear it now
you’re talking down to me like i’ll always be around
you push my love away like it’s some kind of loaded gun
boy, you never thought i’d run

[chorus]
sometimes, in the middle of the night, i can feel you again
but i just miss you, and i just wish you were a better man
and i know why we had to say goodbye
like the back of my hand
and i just miss you, and i just wish you were a better man
a better man
better man

[bridge]
i hold onto this pride because these days it’s all i have
and i gave you my best and we both know you can’t say that
you can’t say that
i wish you were a better man
i wonder what we would’ve become
if you were a better man
we might still be in love
if you were a better man
you would’ve been the one
if you were a better man
yeah, yeah

Cry Pretty,Carrie Underwood,country,"

take a deep breath
do the opposite of what you wanna do

and realize it was worth the while

my heart's full of regret
that's why i'm down here on my knees
so if you can forgive me
why can't she?

[verse 2]
i got careless
i let her hand slip out of mine into someone else's
asking her to come back now just seems so selfish
but i'm asking anyway
it might be helpless
maybe this mistake is a taste of what hell is
make her believe there's good in me through all this wreckage
before it's too late

god, tonight i'm calling out
but just a prayer ain't saving me
i can't undo the wrong i've done

Every Storm (Runs Out Of Rain),Gary Allan,country,"

[verse 1]
i saw you standing in the middle of the thunder and lightning
i know you're feeling like you just can't win, but you're trying
it's hard to keep on keeping on when you're being pushed around
don't even know which way is up
you just keep spinnin' down, 'round down

every storm runs, runs out of rain
just like every dark night turns into day
every heartache will fade away
just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

so hold your head up and tell yourself
that there's something more
and walk out that door
go find a new rose
don't be afraid of the thorns
'cause we all have thorns
just put your feet up to the edge
put your face in the wind
and when you fall back down
keep on rememberin'

[chorus]
every storm runs, runs out of rain
just like every dark night turns into day
every heartache will fade away

to the rhythm of the awful rusted machines
we toss and turn but don't sleep
each breath we take makes us thieves
like causes without rebels
just talk but promise nothing else

under a sky no longer blue
we sweat all day long for you
but we sow seeds to see us through
cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
we wait to reap what we are due

and the blare of the sirens combing the streets
chased down like dogs we run from
your grasp until the sun comes up

we sweat all day long for you
but we sow seeds to see us through

the engine roars and then it gives
but never dies

we just survive
on the scraps that you throw away

pulled off his coat, said ""the night is short.""
he reached in his pocket and he flashed a quart

he hollered, ""rave on, children, i'm with ya!
rave on, cats,"" he cried
""it's almost dawn and the cops are gone
let's all get dixie fried.""

well, dan got happy and he started raving
he pulled out a razor, but he wasn't shaving
and all the cats knew to jump and hop
cause he was born and raised in a butcher shop

he hollered, ""rave on, children, i'm with ya!
rave on, cats,"" he cried
""it's almost dawn and the cops are gone
let's all get dixie fried.""

the cops heard dan when he started to shout
they all ran in to see what it was about
and i heard him holler as they led him away
he turned his head, and this is what he had to say

he hollered, ""rave on children, i'm with ya!
rave on, cats,"" he cried
""it's almost dawn and the cops are gone
let's all get dixie fried.""

now, dan was the bravest man that we ever saw
he let us all know he wasn't scared of the law
and through the black crossed bars
he tossed a note to his dear
said ""it ain't my fault, hon, that i'm in here.""

but hollered, ""rave on, children, i'm with you!
rave on, cats,"" he cried

""it's almost dawn and the cops ain't gone

says ""i need you here""
and it's half past four and i'm shifting gear

we've got a thing that's called radar love
we've got a wave in the air
radar love

the radio's playing some forgotten song
brenda lee's ""coming on strong""
the road has got me hypnotized
and i'm speeding into a new sunrise

when i get lonely and i'm sure i've had enough
she sends her comfort coming in from above
don't need no letter at all
we've got a thing that's called radar love
we've got a line in the sky
radar love

[verse 3]
no more speed i'm almost there
gotta keep cool now gotta take care
last car to pass here i go
and the line of cars drove down real slow
and the radio played that forgotten song
brenda lee's ""coming on strong""
and the newsman sang his same song
one more radar love is gone

Hurricane,Bob Dylan,rock,"

[verse 1]
pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
enter patty valentine from the upper hall
she sees the bartender in a pool of blood
cries out, “my god, they killed them all!”

[hook]
here comes the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world

[verse 2]
three bodies lyin' there
does patty see
and another man named bello
moving around mysteriously
“i didn’t do it,” he says
and he throws up his hands
“i was only robbin' the register
i hope you understand

[verse 3]
i saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“one of us had better call up the cops”
and so patty calls the cops
and they arrive on the scene
with their red lights flashin'
in the hot new jersey night

[verse 4]
meanwhile, far away in another part of town
rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

[verse 5]
when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
just like the time before and the time before that
in paterson that’s just the way things go
if you’re black
you might as well not show up on the street
unless you want to draw the heat

[verse 6]
alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowling around
he said, “i saw two men running out
they looked like middleweights
they jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”

[verse 7]
and miss patty valentine just nodded her head
cop said, “wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
so they took him to the infirmary
and though this man could hardly see
they told him that he could identify the guilty men

[verse 8]
four in the morning and they haul rubin in
they take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
the wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
says, “why did you bring him in here for?
he ain't the guy!”

[hook]
here’s the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world

[verse 9]
four months later, the ghettos are in flame
rubin’s in south america, fighting for his name
while arthur dexter bradley’s still in the robbery game
and the cops are putting the screws to him
lookin' for somebody to blame

[verse 10]
“remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“you think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“think it might-a been that fighter that you saw
running that night?”
“don’t forget that you are white”

[verse 11]
arthur dexter bradley said, “i’m really not sure”
the cops said, “a poor boy like you could use a break
we got you for the motel job
and we’re talking to your friend bello
now you don’t want to have to go back to jail
be a nice fellow

[verse 12]
you’ll be doing society a favor
that sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
we want to put his ass in stir
we want to pin this triple murder
on him
he ain’t no gentleman jim”

[verse 13]
rubin could take a man out with just one punch
but he never did like to talk about it all that much
""it’s my work"", he’d say, ""and i do it for pay
and when it’s over i’d just as soon go on my way""

[verse 14]
up to some paradise
where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
and ride a horse along a trail
but then they took him to the jailhouse
where they try to turn a man
into a mouse

[verse 15]
all of rubin’s cards were marked in advance
the trial was a pig-circus
he never had a chance
the judge made rubin’s witnesses
drunkards from the slums
to the white folks who watched
he was a revolutionary bum

[verse 16]
and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
no one doubted that he pulled the trigger
and though they could not produce the gun
the d.a. said he was the one
who did the deed
and the all-white jury agreed

[verse 17]
rubin carter was falsely tried
the crime was murder “one,”
guess who testified?
bello and bradley and they both baldly lied
and the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

[verse 18]
how can the life of such a man
be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
to see him obviously framed
couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed
to live in a land
where justice is a game

[verse 19]
now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
are free to drink martinis
and watch the sun rise
while rubin sits like buddha
in a ten-foot cell
an innocent man in a living hell

[outro]
yes that’s the story of the hurricane
but it won’t be over till they clear his name
and give him back the time he’s done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world

inte visste vi vad kärlek var
förr'n lilla dagny kom till stan
nu sitter vi där och doppar skorporna
på kafé sjuan hela dan
och alla så ropar vi i kör att:

dagny, kom hit och spill
oh, oh, oh, dagny, fem droppar till
hör hur mitt hjärta sjunger trall dill dill

solbrun gick hon mellan våra bord
ja, hon var nästan alldeles svart
vi satt och tryckte på små kärleksord
men liksom kom ej någon vart
för så fort nå'n försökte skrek dom andra:
dagny, . . . . 

vi spelade på grammofonen där
och titta' snett uppå varann
wienerbröna, mazarinerna och
sockerkakorna försvann
i fyra små feta killar som sjöng:
dagny, . . . . 

allting hade kanske slutat bra
om inte dagny sagt en dag:
hejsan älsklingar, nu bjuder jag
och ni får ta vad ni vill ha
oj, oj, vad vi svällde upp på grund av:
dagny, .. . . . 

i saligt rus av hennes vackra ord
vi glömde bort att säga tack
vi åt och drack så allihopa sprack
och i tapeten sa det smack!
ruinerna sjunger ännu där om:

until it sound just like a symphony

well, i know a cool cat from way downtown

now, farmer jones, he came to town

take a line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
i see you out on the streets, calling for a wild time
so you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do
there's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you
you know she likes the lights at nights on the neon broadway signs
she don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find

American Pie,Don McLean,rock,"

a long, long time ago
i can still remember
how that music used to make me smile
and i knew if i had my chance
that i could make those people dance
and maybe they'd be happy for a while
but february made me shiver
with every paper i'd deliver
bad news on the doorstep
i couldn't take one more step
i can’t remember if i cried
when i read about his widowed bride
but something touched me deep inside
the day the music died

[chorus]
so bye-bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
and them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
and singin', ""this’ll be the day that i die""
""this’ll be the day that i die.""

[verse 2]
did you write the book of love
and do you have faith in god above
if the bible tells you so?
now do you believe in rock 'n roll
can music save your mortal soul?
and can you teach me how to dance real slow?
well, i know that you're in love with him
'cause i saw you dancin' in the gym
you both kicked off your shoes
man, i dig those rhythm and blues
i was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
with a pink carnation and a pickup truck
but i knew i was out of luck
the day the music died

[pre-chorus]
i started singin'

[chorus]
""bye-bye, miss american pie""
drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye

[verse 3]
now for ten years we've been on our own
and moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
but that’s not how it used to be
when the jester sang for the king and queen
in a coat he borrowed from james dean
and a voice that came from you and me
oh, and while the king was looking down
the jester stole his thorny crown
the courtroom was adjourned
no verdict was returned
and while lennon read a book on marx
the quartet practiced in the park
and we sang dirges in the dark
the day the music died

[pre-chorus]
we were singin'

[chorus]
""bye-bye, miss american pie""

""this'll be the day that i die.""

[verse 4]
helter skelter in a summer swelter
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter
eight miles high and fallin' fast
it landed foul on the grass
the players tried for a forward pass
with the jester on the sidelines in a cast
now the half-time air was sweet perfume
while the sergeants played a marching tune
we all got up to dance
oh, but we never got the chance
'cause the players tried to take the field
the marching band refused to yield
do you recall what was revealed
the day the music died?

[pre-chorus]
we started singin'

""bye-bye, miss american pie""
drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye

""this'll be the day that i die.""

[verse 5]
oh, and there we were all in one place
a generation lost in space
with no time left to start again
so come on, jack be nimble, jack be quick
jack flash sat on a candlestick, 'cause
fire is the devil’s only friend
oh, and as i watched him on the stage
my hands were clenched in fists of rage
no angel born in hell
could break that satan's spell
and as the flames climbed high into the night
to light the sacrificial rite
i saw satan laughing with delight
the day the music died

[pre-chorus]
we were singin'

[chorus]
""bye-bye miss american pie""
drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
and singin', ""this'll be the day that i die""
""this'll be the day that i die...""

[breakdown]
i met a girl who sang the blues
and i asked her for some happy news
but she just smiled and turned away
i went down to the sacred store
where i'd heard the music years before
but the man there said the music wouldn't play
and in the streets, the children screamed
the lovers cried and the poets dreamed
but not a word was spoken
the church bells all were broken
and the three men i admire most
the father, son, and the holy ghost
they caught the last train for the coast
the day the music died

[deleted verse]
and there i stood alone and afraid
i dropped to my knees and there i prayed
and i promised him everything i could give
if only he would make the music live
and he promised it would live once more
but this time one would equal four
and in five years four had come to mourn
and the music was reborn

[pre-chorus]
and they were singin'

stroke has struck me, stroke has struck me

i'm a puppet on a string
tracy island, time-traveling
diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
come to find you four in some velvet morning
years too late, she's a silver lining
lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me

[chorus]
i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is ""are you mine?""
well, are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine? woah, ah

[verse 2]
i guess what i'm trying to say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape, lost track of time and space
she's a silver lining climbing on my desire

[chorus]
and i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is ""are you mine?""
well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
are you mine? (are you mine, mine?)

and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case, i'm mistaken, i
just wanna hear you say, ""you got me, baby
are you mine?""
she's a silver lining

in my mind when she's not right there beside me

got to find a reason why my money's all gone
i got a dalmatian and i can still get high
i can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

[verse 2]
well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'cause you might get run over or you might get shot
never start no static, i just get it off my chest
never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
love is what i got, it's within my reach
and the sublime style's still straight from long beach
it all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
try and test that, you're bound to get served
love's what i got, don't start a riot
you'll feel it when the dance gets hot

[chorus]
lovin' is what i got
i said, remember that
lovin' is what i got
and remember that
lovin' is what i got
i said, remember that
lovin' is what i got
(i got, i got, i got)

[verse 3]
why i don't cry when my dog runs away
i don't get angry at the bills i have to pay
i don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
fuckin' and fightin'; it's all the same
living with louie dog's the only way to stay sane
let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

[chorus]
lovin' is what i got
i said, remember that
lovin' is what i got
and remember that
lovin' is what i got
i said remember that
lovin' is what i got

Bitch,The Baseballs,rock,"

she hates the world today
i'm so good to her
she knows but she can't change
tried to tell me
but i look at hey like maybe
she's an angel underneath
innocent and sweet
yesterday she cried
i've been so relieved to see
the softer side
she can understand how i am so confused
she doesn't envy me
she's a little bit of everything
all rolled into one

she's a bitch, she's a lover
she's a child, she's a mother
she's a sinner, she's a saint
she doesn't feel ashamed
she's my hell, she's my dream
she's nothing in between
i know i wouldn't want it any other way

she said:
so take me as i am
this may mean
you'll have to be a stronger man
rest assured that
when i start to make you nervous
and i'm going to extremes
tomorrow i will change
and today won't mean a thing

she's a bitch, she's a lover
she's a child, she's a mother
she's a sinner, she's a saint
she doesn't feel ashamed
she's my hell, she's my dream
she's nothing in between
i know i wouldn't want it any other way

just when i think, i got her figured out
the season's already changing
she thinks it's cool, i do what i do
and don't try to save her

she's a bitch, she's a tease
she's a goddess on her knees
when i hurt, when i suffer
she's my angel undercover
she's been numb, she's revived
she's the devil in disguise
i know i wouldn't want it any other way

she's a bitch, she's a lover
she's a child, she's a mother
she's a sinner, she's a saint
she doesn't feel ashamed
she's my hell, she's my dream
she's nothing in between
i know i wouldn't want it any other way

Bleeding Love,The Baseballs,rock,"

closed off from love, i didn't need the pain
once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
but something happened for the very first time with you
my heart melted to the ground, found something true
and everyone's looking 'round, thinking i'm going crazy

but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i

keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding, i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open

trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
yet i know that their goal is to keep me from falling
but nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace
and in this world of loneliness, i see your face
yet everyone around me thinks that i'm going crazy
maybe, maybe

but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i

keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding, i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open

and it's draining all of me

i'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

well, when i come home this morning
it was still too dark to see
i could tell my baby wasn't sleeping next to me
she's gone and left me
where to i guess i'll never know

[verse 2]
i only know her leave has brought pain and misery to my soul
well, a note was on the pillow, she's gone without a doubt
i tried to read her writing, but i couldn't make it out
'cause tears were falling too fast for me to even read
nobody knows my sorrow, nobody knows my misery

[verse 3]
my friends told me she'd leave me but i said they wasn't right
she gave no word of warning, she'd be leaving in the night
can't understand her, what made my baby want to go?
i didn't hear her leaving, she didn't even close the door
when she'd come home this morning, i'd jump and shout with flee

[verse 4]
she can't mean more to someone else
than what she means to me, i love that woman
i got to have her all the time
i got to have her near me, to ease this misery on my mind

cruising down a highway takes me farther from home
whiskey and regret
neither can erase the fact that i have done wrong

the law is on my trail
let down the only girl that ever seemed to be the one for me
so now i wander alone

alone in a cheap motel room
praying to the lord above
burden of the past rests so heavy on my shoulders
my conscience carries the weight of blood
cigarette smoke and shadow
a neon cactus in the night
did what i did cause i thought that i had no choice
but there's always another way

i look to the moon and stars
somewhere underneath them she's there
never even spoke to her the words of love i held in my heart
if she heard them now, would she still care?
wonder if she's thinking of me
does she hate me for what i've done
how i wish that i could change everything and go back
now that my last chance is gone, it's gone

moon, will you tell her for me
i'm sorry for all the trouble that i've caused
if only i could find a way to return to her someday
for i long to hold her in my arms
but i fear that i'm not for this world
because i will not go out without a fight
i'm running forever, if they should catch me
one last thought of her before my gun is fired

Gravity,Papa Roach,rock,"

blood on my hands throw 'em up in the sky
i was the number one sinner, no less
my life was a lie, and my wish was a death
i fell in love with the ways of the world
money, the fame, the booze, the girls
but i couldn't stay faithful, if i tried
i turned in to a devil, you could see it in my eyes
i blacked out, told everything i ever did
i couldn't take all the lies i was living with
i broke your heart, woke up the next day
my bags outside, yelling, ""get the hell away!
you're not a husband, not a father, just a pig
and you can't never change all the things that you did!""
that's when i knew it, it wouldn't last
you never get away, when you're running from the past

i float away, but you're my gravity
i will die to love another day
we rise again and lose our gravity

i'm a broken man, i'm full of sin
i'm sick of all this hell that i'm living in
and i can't escape it, this is how it feels
when you try to numb the pain with a thousand pills
you tore me down, wished that i was dead
said you wanna sleep alone in another bed
but when i push away, you only pull me closer
it's only over when we both wanna say it's over
i gotta change this is not who i am
i wanna start over wanna try this again
you're everything i need, everything i'm not
so pull the trigger, give me one more shot

i float away, but you're my gravity

you love me, you hate me, you kiss me, you break me
you lifted me up just to watch as you broke me
you promised me, looked me straight in the eyes
no matter what you say, i don't know truth from the lies
i helped you up, like i always do
i forgave you for your sins and i carried you through them
no matter how hard we fought, we always knew
you will bleed for me, and i will bleed for you

here's a little something

i was born as a bastard, no father, no master
a shadow in silence left searching for answers
put up for adoption and left with no option
another kid fostered to fester, forgotten
take a look into these desperate eyes
as they’re cast into the wretched hive
but i ain’t going down alone

is there anybody out there?
anybody listening to me?
is anybody else scared?
the paranoia drops me to my knees
does anybody feel lonely?
disconnected from the things i see
is there anybody out there?
anybody out there just like me?
i’m choking on these words and i can’t breathe

come on
come on

is there anybody there?
come on
come on
lemme say this

now i stand as a father, to men with no honor
ashamed of the racists i used to call brothers
'cause no flag can mean bravery
when bloodied by slavery
the rebel, a devil, disguised as a savior
and the sickening feeling in the air
is the fear to speak that no one dares
so will i stand here all alone?

is there anybody out there?
anybody listening to me?
is anybody else scared?
the paranoia drops me to my knees
does anybody feel lonely?
disconnected from the things i see
is there anybody out there?
anybody out there just like me?
i’m choking on these words and i can’t breathe

live my life like i’ll die tonight
dream like i’ll live forever
live my life like i’ll die tonight
dream like i’ll live forever

(is there anybody out there?)
i have roared at the world for years
(is there anybody out there?)
doesn’t anybody hear me?
(is there anybody out there?)
this burden suffered, i’ve paid the cost
(is there anybody out there?)
not all who wander are lost

is there anybody
is there anybody
is there anybody

is there anybody out there?
anybody listening to me?

and the wind cries mary
after all the jacks are in their boxes
and the clowns have all gone to bed
you can hear happiness staggering on down the street
footprints dress in red
and the wind whispers mary
a broom is drearily sweeping
up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
somewhere a queen is weeping
somewhere a king has no wife
and the wind it cries mary
the traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
and shine their emptiness down on my bed
the tiny island sags downstream
'cos the life that they lived is dead
and the wind screams mary
will the wind ever remember
the names it has blown in the past
and with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
it whispers, ""no, this will be the last.""
and the wind cries mary

Somebody That I Used To Know,Gotye,rock,"

now and then i think of when we were together
like when you said you felt so happy you could die
i told myself that you were right for me
but felt so lonely in your company
but that was love and it's an ache i still remember

[verse 2: gotye]
you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
like resignation to the end, always the end
so when we found that we could not make sense
well, you said that we would still be friends
but i'll admit that i was glad it was over

[chorus: gotye]
but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i don't even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
no, you didn't have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
i guess that i don't need that though
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know

[verse 3: kimbra]
now and then i think of all the times you screwed me over
but had me believing it was always something that i'd done
but i don't wanna live that way
reading into every word you say
you said that you could let it go
and i wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[chorus: gotye & kimbra]
but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (ahhh)

there’s colors on the street
red, white, and blue
people shuffling their feet

i see a woman in the night
with a baby in her hand
there's an old street light
near a garbage can
now she put the kid away and she’s gone to get a hit
she hates her life and what she’s done to it
there’s one more kid that’ll never go to school
never get to fall in love, never get to be cool

face down in the boulevard

your friends, they all sympathize
maybe i don’t need them to

you'll have to go and find it with someone new

they slip through your fingertips
because they never happened to you
time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view

the way we've always done before

my hands are tied
the billions shift from side to side
an' the wars go on with brainwashed pride
for the love of god and our human rights
an' all these things are swept aside
by bloody hands, time can't deny
an' are washed away by your genocide
an' history hides the lies of our civil wars

that you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
when everybody's fightin' for their promised land

look at the lies we've swallowed
an' i don't want to hear no more

my hands are tied
for all, i've seen has changed my mind
but still, the wars go on, as the years go by
with no love of god or human rights

who carry the cross of homicide
and history bears the scars of our civil wars

all reason left behind
without a warning it comes flying-
and its too late to resist it for my fate is sealed

a feeling so strong
a scarlet fever burns my soul
from this moment on

it burns away all that has passed
and draws me to her side
""a direct hit"" the cupid smiles...
wounded, i fall into delrium
and i know... my heart's no longer mine

yo' man, i don't think they heard you?
won't you tell 'em what ya name is?

[verse 1: eazy-e]
my name is eazy, yeah, this is true
keepin' your attention is what i'm gonna do
hardcore, yo' i could never be soft
askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
fillin' up my memo with a touch of my rhyme
suckers stayin' with me cause they know the time
quiet on the set because i'm about to begin
and if you didn't hear me boy i'll tell you again
my name is eazy or just call me e
but it doesn't really matter to me
'cause i'm the same person
whether serious or rehearsin'
i just gotta keep cursin'
this is for the radio so i better chill
they won't play it if i cold get ill
but i'm like that and that's an actual fact
because the street is where my heart is at
yo' i don't do dope but i'm dope not a dope
but i'm doper than anybody who tries to cope
if the rhyme i'm displayin'
and the beat that's playin'
yo', you could try all-day
and you still won't match up with the ruthless p.o.w
cause eazy's doin' it compton style
thats the city and you say you could get some
yo', it's easier said than done

[chorus: eazy-e]
woo, woo!

[verse 2: eazy-e & mc ren]
now it's easy for me to get my point across
so listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
i'm not a role model or a dr. seuss yo i'm a gangsta
and i'm about to get stupid
i guess its time for the trauma
with the e-a-z-y-e comma now that's drama
so pay attention by the way i must mention
i'm comin' off hard in the third dimension
with the glare
but you don't need no glasses to stare
it'll probably take you in and it's just like you're there
with the e on the gangsta tip
so if you think i'm a flip or slip don't even trip
cause i'm a destroyer
my homie dre is a doctor not a lawyer
dope mc employer on ruthless and that's my label
to get the money, the women, and cold bust the fat cables, boy
master rhyme's a toy
i mean straight, while you suckin' with the girls enjoy
you must be sick, or you lonely
how you gonna diss me if you don't even know me? (yo ren!)
whassup?
get the gat show 'em where it's at
and that's just the sound
and next time i'm peelin' your cap
to let you know where i'm comin' from
eazy said it and it shall be done

[chorus: eazy-e]
woo, woo!

[verse 3: eazy-e & mc ren]
creating dope jams is a part of the cycle
""eazy-er said than dunn"", yeah, that's the title
lovin' the ladies, only the fly ones, ya know?
but what if she's ugly?
eazy come eazy go
don't ask to battle me, homeboy, what's that?
you wanna battle me? boy, ya better be strapped
'cause where i'm from it ain't all about that playin'
now, that's what i'm sayin'
said before that i was born in '73
now everybody wants to know the a-g-e
girls on the tip, fellas too, it seemed
had everybody thinkin' i was only 15
the fellas would ignore me
the ladies would adore me
and what was i to do?
i wish they’d let the ladies through
'cause the ladies, i love 'em
nice, tender and soft
i hate male groupies so just step the hell off
i'm the real eazy, those others be fakin'

the bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin'
with screamin hostages, running and chokin'
gettin away, but i was suddenly stopped
at point blank range, by a motherfucking cop
and i hope they don't think that a lesson was taught
cause a nigga like the e was finally caught
my gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work
so, y'all know what time it is

okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
crew at my house and we party every weekend so
on the radio, that's my favorite song
make me bounce around, like i don't know, like i won't be here long
now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause i'm not a doctor
girl why is you lying, girl why you mufasa
yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like gaza
got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
yeah, we spit that saliva, iphone got message from viber
either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""my god, you pay for your friends?"" i'll take that as a compliment
got a house full of homies, why i feel so the opposite?
incompetent ain't the half of it
saturdays we're young lavish-ing
saddest shit, is i'm bad as it
beans they took from the cabinet (woah)
sorry, i'm just scared of the future
till 3005, i got your back, we can do this, hold up

[verse 2]
i used to care what people thought, but now i care more
i mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
so, therefore, i've lost all hope of a happy ending
depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
we spend it with no shame, we blow that like coltrane
we in here like rogaine, or leave it like cobain
and when i'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a lambo like lebron's mom
and no matter where all of my friends go, emily, fam, and lorenzo
all of them people my kinfolk, at least i think so, can't tell
'cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but i'm laughing whatever happens
assassins, i'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
labrador yapping, i'm glad that it happened, i mean it
between us, i think there's something special, and if i lose my mental
just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up

as i look up at the sky
my mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
my body temperature falls
i'm shaking and they break in trying to save the dogg
pumping on my chest and i'm screaming
i stop breathing, damn i see demons
dear god, i wonder can you save me
i can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
i think it's too late for praying, hold up
a voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(bring your lifestyle to me, i'll make it better)
how long will i live? (eternal life and forever)
and will i be the g that i was?
(i'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
so relax your soul, let me take control
close your eyes my son) my eyes are closed

i got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner
it's gonna take a miracle they say
for me to walk again and talk again but anyway
i get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
and everything that nigga said came to reality
living like a baller loc
having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
i bought my momma a benz, and bought my boo boo a jag
and now i'm rolling in a nine-trizzay el do-rag
(just remember who changed your mind
cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
never have a want, never have a need
they say i'm greedy but i still want mo'
cuz my eyes wanna journey some mo', really doe (check it out)

if i should die, before i wake
i pray the lord, my soul to take

shackled from head to toe

cause it's the o.g. d-o-double-g, l-b-c
mad dogging niggas cause i don't care
red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
niggas stare as i enter the center
they send me to a level three yard, that's where i stay
late night i hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
cause you can't tell what's next
my little homie baby boo took a pencil in his neck
and he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
i put that on my momma; i'ma ride for you baby boo

i control my own life, charles was never in charge
no sitcom could teach scott about the dram
or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
on christmas time, my mom christmas grind
got me most of what i wanted, how'd you do it, mom, huh?
she copped the toys i would play with in my room by myself
""why he by himself?""

an independent older sister kept me fly when she could

i'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
since my father died, i ain't been right since
and i tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
split an eighth of shrooms just so i could see the universe
i try and think about myself as a sacrifice
just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
the moon will illuminate my room
and soon i'm consumed by my doom
once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
it's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
so now i'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
my heart's an open sore that i hope heals soon
i live in a cocoon opposite of cancún
where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
so it's more than right, i try and shed some light on a man
not many people of this planet understand, fam

i'm this close to go and trying some coke
and a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss
ignorance is love and i need that shit
if i never did shows then i'd prolly be a myth
if i cared about the blogs then i'd prolly be a jackass
don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
haters shake my hand but i keep the sanitizer on deck
hope i really get to see 30
wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
most of the clean faces be the most dirty
i just need a thoroughbred, cook when i'm hungry
ass all chunky, brain is insanity
only things that calm me down: pussy and some cali tree
and i get both, never truly satisfied
i am happy, that's just the saddest lie

We Own It (Fast & Furious),2 Chainz,hiphop,"

[intro: wiz khalifa & 2 chainz]
it's young khalifa, man
2 chainz!

[verse 1: 2 chainz]
money's the motivation, money's the conversation
you on vacation, we gettin' paid, so
we on paycation, i did it for the fam
it's whatever we had to do, it's just who i am
yeah, it's the life i chose
gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
and we got it cookin' like a one-eyed stove
you can catch me kissin' my girl with both eyes closed, yeah
perfectin' my passion, thanks for askin'
couldn't slow down, so we had to crash it
you used plastic, we 'bout cash
i see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!

[pre-chorus: wiz khalifa]
i never feared death or dyin' (woo)
i only fear never tryin' (woo)
i am whatever i am
only god can judge me now

[chorus: wiz khalifa]
one shot, everything rides on tonight
even if i've got three strikes, i'ma go for it
this moment, we own it
and i'm not to be played with
because it can get dangerous
see these people i ride with?
this moment (uh), we own it

[verse 2: wiz khalifa]
and the same ones that i ride with
be the same ones that i die with
put it all out on the line with
if you lookin' for me, you can find wiz
in a new car or the crowd with
my new broad, that's a fine chick
ain't no other squad i'm down with
ain't no way around it
what you say? tell me what you say
workin' hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this every day
takin' off, lookin' out for all, makin' sure we ball
like the mob, all you do is call
catch you if you fall, young khalifa

[pre-chorus: wiz khalifa]
i never feared death or dyin' (woo)
i only fear never tryin' (woo) (uh)
i am whatever i am
only god can judge me now

[chorus: wiz khalifa & 2 chainz]
one shot, everything rides on tonight
even if i've got three strikes, i'ma go for it
this moment, we own it
and i'm not to be played with (i ride or die for mine)
because it can get dangerous
see these people i ride with? (i ride or die for love)
this moment, we own it

[verse 3: 2 chainz]
this the biggest day of my life
we got big guns, been graduated from knives
it's the day in the life and i'm ready to ride
got the spirit, i'm feelin' like a killer inside, uh
financial outbreak, i'm free but i ain't out yet
ridin' with the plug, so i'm close to the outlet
at the red light, rims sittin' offset
i look better on your girl than her outfit (uh)

[verse 4: wiz khalifa]
stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
we the fam and loyalty never change up
been down since day one, look at where we came from
jumpin' out on anybody who try to say some
one thing about it: got a problem? i got the same one
money rolls, we fold
plenty clubs we closed
follow the same code
never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control

[chorus: wiz khalifa & 2 chainz]
one shot, everything rides on tonight
even if i've got three strikes, i'ma go for it
this moment, we own it
and i'm not to be played with (i ride or die for mine)
because it can get dangerous
see these people i ride with? (i ride or die for love)
this moment, we own it

[outro: 2 chainz & wiz khalifa]
hahaha
uh
this moment, we own it
i ride or die for mine
i'm ride or die material
one life to live, so here we go
this moment, we own it

- - - thank you's - - -

words cannot accurately express the gratitude i feel towards the universe for
selecting me to become a character such as “b.o.b” and have the opportunity
to impact worldwide consciousness. i would also like to take this time to give
credit for the parents who were courageous enough to give birth to a wild son
such as myself, bobby simmons sr. and karen simmons
although i am the face of the movement, there is always a proper team
behind any successful project. b-rich, tj chapman, and playboy tre have been
like uncles for me on my journey and constantly make sure that i’m grounded
we have put in a lot of blood, sweat, tears, pain, happiness, and patience into
what is unfolding and now we can celebrate the release of the debut album. i
am grateful to have a team to invest so much time and energy into one project
ham squad on deck!!! sklooo!
tiffany, first i have to thank you for all of the creative ideas and concepts that
you have given me out of the pure love for art. secondly, i have to thank you for
staying in my corner through my roughest times because if it were not for you
b.o.b would be lost
since a year ago i have prayed that the universe would bring musicians in
my life who were just as passionate about music as i am…well those prayers
were answered which is why i am privileged to be working with awesome
musicians such as kyle king, takehiko kato, arielle simmons, and delarry
sanders. whether on the road or in the studio, the chemistry is divine
there have been very crucial bits of information and advice that i have
received throughout my journeys into the universe but the most impactful ones
have come from my brother jamaal. thank you for listening to my horrible raps
back in the day…now they’re not so bad eh? gracias!
stephen hill - although you are my cousin, you will always be my brother in
my eyes. from the days that we were sneaking into clubs, to the days that we
were the klinic, all of this started as a dream and has manifested into something
way greater than what we envisioned. i have to express and acknowledge my
gratitude for you inspiring me to be greater as a man and stand up! lol
the simmons family
the hill family
jim jonsin - you have taught me so much in the studio and have shown me
how to really put my elbows into a record!! lol. i would like to thank you for
believing in b.o.b since we walked into that studio in miami that day! rebel
rock!!!!!
latrice burnette - c’mon son!!!!! you are one of the hardest working people
that i know alone! you go way over and beyond to make sure that me and
team b.o.b are okay and we will always have a place in our hearts for you
you will always be family to us!
sydney margetson - getting the word out to the masses about the existence of
b.o.b is something that would not have been possible without your contribution
to the project. it takes actual care and effort to pull that off. thanks
brian “busy” dackowski - obviously from the name, you are always busy
making sure we have the best looks, and the best ideas in this new age of
internet and technology. so on behalf of myself and team b.o.b…thank you!

got us bustin' off these pistols, my niggas got issues
again, same song armed with the mega bomb
blow you out the frame and then i'm gone

[verse 2: redman]
yo, i was gone too but we roam, cellular phones

moon-walk platoon hawk my goons bark
leave you in a blue lagoon lost (true)
three nines in the glove with masu, d-don and the gov'
right behind on a bus
haters don't touch (what?) weigh us both up
now my neighbor doped up
got the cable hooked up, all channels
lift my shirt all mammal

sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump

come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
she needs to get a piece of the american pie and take her bite out
that's my house, i'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
and let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—i pay that
i love your mom and everything
but see, i ain't the only one who laid down
she wanna rib you up to start a custody war
my lawyers stay down
she never got a chance to hear my side of the story
we was divided
she had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, i ain't invited
despite it i show her the utmost respect when i fall through
all you, do is defend that lady when i call you, yeah

me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
you say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (arroof)
hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
you can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
ms. jackson

ten times out of nine, now if i'm lyin', find
the quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and i'll decline
king meets queen, then the puppy love thing
together dream 'bout that crib with the goodyear swing
on the oak tree, i hope we feel like this forever
forever, forever ever? forever, ever?
forever never seems that long until you're grown
and notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
ms. jackson, my intentions were good, i wish i could
become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
i pray so much about it, need some knee pads
it happened for a reason, one can't be mad
so know this, know that everything's cool
and yes, i will be present on the first day of school and graduation

hurry up and give me the microphone before i bust in my pants
the mad author of anguish, my language polluted
onyx is heavyweight and still undisputed
you took the words right out my mouth now walk a mile in my shoes
i paid so many dues, i feel used and abused and i’m so confused
excuse me, for example i’m an inspiration of a whole generation
and unless you got ten sticky fingers it’s an imitation
a figment of your imagination
bu-bu-bu-but wait it gets worse
i’m not watered down so i’m dying of thirst
coming through with a scam, foolproof plan
b-boys make some noise, and just, just slam

[verse 1]
i remember (back in the days)
when i just a little niggarole
i looked up to my bigger bro
begged if i could kick it so
when he went out with girls i could go tagging along
nagging if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
all the way live, i think i was about ten
one of those happy little niggas singing the blues
that be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes
sayin ""yo momma black; his momma this, his momma that""
then he get mad and wanna scrap
we stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
to play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows
then switch to playing ding dong ditch, when that gets
old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
you could tell the ballers cuz they bell wearing gazelles
and if they really had money raised be sporting bk's
and, all the girls had they turkish link
if it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
but, sometimes, i still sit and reminisce
then, think about the years i was raised, back in the days

i'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87
'88 that's when my crew and i were in junior high
in 7th grade, i hated school (wish it'd blown up)
no doubt i couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)
but let me finish this reminiscing and telling
'bout when girls was belling tight corduroys like for the boys
basket weaves, nike cortez, and footsie socks
and eating pickles, with tootsie pops
and it don't stop, i'm glad cause when j.j. fad hit supersonic
it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
or to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
of hoochies had poison airbrushed on they asses
dudes had on nike suits, and the pumas with
the fat laces cause it was either that or k-swiss
i miss those days and so i pout like a grown jerk
wishing all i had to do now, was finish homework
it's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
and i'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
sometimes i do sit and reminisce then
think about the years i was raised, back in the days

because i'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say i'm holding
down a steady job and crew steady mobbing
you steady bobbing your head and i'm paid, so i got it made
but, didn't always have clout, used to live in south central l.a
that's where i stayed and figured a way out
i gave it all i had so for what it's worth
i went from rags to riches which is a drag but now i'm first
so ahmad and the jones' is on our way up
yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
and we finally did, but

i put my hand above my hip, i bet you dip, he dip, she dip
i say i get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
my pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
i just arrive in a rolls, i just came up in a wraith
i need to fill up the tank, no, i need to fill up the safe
i need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
i go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate

so you wipe your mouth and you try to explain
you start talking real fast
but he already mad 'cause you fucking his woman

joe louis didn't make that much money
come in here, get your ass out the house
coming here with that bullshit,"" hah

[verse 1]
niggas hating on me, i ain't used to that
know a couple people wanna shoot for that
i say ""no, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that""
them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
and if it work for them, well shit, i'm cool with that
'cause how they feel, i ain't got shit to do with that
i just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
and trip off how much bread them crackers take from that

it's been a long time since i have felt this way
about something but now, but now
i'm controlling my mind, the days are warm
the nights are cold, the lost is found, i'm found
lord knows i need something to fill this void

hell yeah boy, i'm a goddamn millionaire now
hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that
bitch, got my first motherfuckin' million dollar check nigga
i'm goddamn lit boy, you crazy as hell
hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my unc'
uncle sam and shit
""what's up unc'? yup. hey, i told you that check was coming in, i gotchu when it came in. goddamn, i'm a man of my word. goddamn, i told you i'ma have it, and goddamn, i'ma have it for you. hell, shit, damn right. now, how much was it though? uh huh. huh? half? half nigga? you crazy, boy, you crazy. bitch, you crazy as fuck. bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!

[verse 2]
yeah, i pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
where do my dollars go? you see lately, i ain't been convinced
i guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
but my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
maybe 'cause the tax dollars that i make sure i send
get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
and the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars i spend
got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
one thing about the men that's controlling the pen
that write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
maybe we'll never see a black man in the white house again
i'll write a check to the irs, my pockets get slim
damn, do i even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
some older nigga told me to start votin'
i said ""democracy is too fuckin' slow""
if i'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, i wanna know
better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
let me pick the things i'm funding from an app on my screen
better that than letting wack congressman i've never seen
dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country and then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
from the concrete, he was prolly rose
now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
he did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
so right now, he got two on the way
still sleep on covers in his mama house
she can't take this shit no more, she want him out
on the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
she remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn

my life story strictly business, never blew my chance
moms kicked me out the house when i was flipping ""i'm the man""
put the boys on the street, make them walk this beat
teach them how to eat, and to seek for peace
son i stamped this name living proof 'cause i mean what i say
bring the fake to reality and make them pay
yo these ghetto rhyme stories got 'em scared to death
i'm trying to get the fuck out, see what the world's about
check it, 1986 is when i reached my peak
take my brothers outta state and tried to make some ends meet
first destination texas and it's just like that
making moves with my brothers and there's no turning back
we got thirty-six grams on the scale right now
getting ready with my brothers time to break the shit down
i'm not about killing my people but you know how it go
work with me not against me and we'll make mad dough
wear my co-defendant out when i break down with rap
hold me back and give me love and now i'm giving it back
a unique sound from the streets and it's just so sweet
my living proof life story, let me break it in peace

yo, i rock on the block with the real hip-hop
as you start to clock... and jock
yo, i'm coming off with mad rage
eighteen, and hitting the real stage
but don't worry 'bout me, 'cause i'm making it
and if i can't have it, then i'm taking it
that's how it is, 'cause i'm living trife
where's my knife? take a chance with your life
rappers decapitate, and disintegrate
you i will mutilate, when i penetrate
go for the one when i say raid
a hitman for hire and i wanna get paid
'cause bullets are sprayed and anybody is laid
more money is made and that's the family trade
see, i make moves and tell what's the truth
that's why i'm here, to be living proof

and i'm ready to rip on my combat
beef, i'm not having that, yo, i pull my trigger back
and all you pussy niggas know where my heart is at
i like to stay down low but yo i flip at times
like when i'm kicking lines, or busting out nines
it's like that, should i jump off the roof
sike, 'cause i wouldn't be living proof

""kick the truth to the young black youth""

the moral of the story—what the fuck's going on?
and our seeds won't see 2000 if these niggas keep frontin'
i used to hustle on the block, now i rock for papes
watch as the world turn, and i will come back
relieving stress off my brain, i got the la-la for that
breaking down all subjects, and then all facts
letting loose everyday, but still, keeping it fat
bust it, niggas keep on fronting in this game, a'ight?
scared to death ass rappers don't get no props
scared to come to the ghetto talkin' 'bout busting shots
see, i can walk around the ghetto, stand in peace and at ease
get my ghetto crowd open, yo, you know what i mean?
indeed, see what i see and then you know what i mean
getting ready for the future so don't fuck with me
my living proof life story niggas i kill it with ease...

i got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
until i die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when i'm high
fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
'cause all i want is cash and thangs
a five-double-0 benz, flauntin' flashy rings
uhh, bitches pursue me like a dream
been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
it seems, my main thing was to be major paid
the game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
one nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers die
depend on me like the first and fifteenth
they might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
we got four niggas in low riders and ski masks
screamin', ""thug life"" every time they pass, all eyes on me

[chorus: 2pac]
live the life of a thug nigga until the day i die
live the life of a boss player (all eyes on me) 'cause even gettin' high
all eyes on me
live the life of a thug nigga until the day i die
live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high

hey, to my nigga 'pac

[verse 2: big syke]
so much trouble in the world, nigga
can't nobody feel your pain
the world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
my girl said i need a raise, how long will she last?
i'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as i dip
i'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
needy hookers got a lot of nerve
let my bucket swerve, i'm takin' off from the curb
the nervousness neglect make me pack a tec
devoted to servin' this moët and pay checks
like akai satellite, nigga, i'm forever ballin'
it ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
my devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
where you goin', i been there, came back as lonely, homie
steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
it's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
it ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
what can i do? what can i say? is there another way?
blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
my little homie g, can't you see i'm buster-free?
niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me

[verse 3: 2pac]
the feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
will i survive? will i die? come on, let's picture the possibility
givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
i told the judge i was raised wrong and that's why i blaze shit
was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
on my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
bitches, i fuck with a passion, i'm livin' rough and raw
catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
live my life as a thug nigga until the day i die
live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high
these niggas got me tossin' shit
i put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
up in the benz, burnin' rubber
the money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
this criminal lifestyle, equipped with a bulletproof vest
make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket, get your money
motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it; all eyes on me

[chorus: 2pac]
live the life of a thug nigga until the day i die

[intro]
man, duke i was in love with this girl, duke
i was tore up dog, i'm telling you man
shit is wild man, for real
it's, she's from, let me tell you about her

[verse 1]
in she came with the same type game
the type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name
big fame, she like cats with big things
jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
i seen her on the ave, spotted her more than once
ass so fat that you could see it from the front
she spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
in that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn!
what's your name love, where you came from?
neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
the swims at the reebok gym tone your frame up
is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
i tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
asked her to dance and she was like, ""yo, i'm leaving now""
an hour later, sounds from jamaica
she's sipping cris straight up, skanking, winding her waist up
scene 2 - my fam's throwing a jam
fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
the brother big mu makes space for me to move
""ayo, this my man mos, baby, let me introduce""
i turned around (say word!) it was the same pretty bird
who i had priorly observed trying to play me for the herb (yeah, that's her)
shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
i just played along and pretended i never met her
how you feeling? ""oh, i'm fine"" my name is mos ""i'm sharice""
i heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet
we moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
and honey love ended up sitting directly next to me
i'm type polite but now i'm looking at her skeptically
cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
designer fabric, shoes and accessories
chinky eyes, sweet voice is fucking with me mentally
we conversated, made her laugh, yeah, you know me bro
even though i know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
i'm 'bout to murk, i say peace to the family
she hop up like, ""how you gon' leave before you dance with me?""

[hook]
i know i can't afford to stop
for one moment, that it's too soon to forget
i know i can't afford to stop
for one moment, that it's too soon to forget

[interlude]
she blew my whole head with that duke, i was like, word?
i played it low though, i was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go
niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, i tell (ya)
yo, honey was so blazing she was just
yo, she looked like jayne kennedy, word bond, to my mother man
she was that ill man, she take me to the dance floor
and she start whispering to me (and shit)

[verse 2]
""yo, let me apologize for the other night
i know it wasn't right, but baby you know what it's like
some brothers don't be coming right""
i understand, i'm feeling you
besides, ""can i have a dance?"" ain't really that original
we laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
they playing lovers rock, i got the folded fingers on her waist
heating my blood up like the arizona summer
song finished then she whispered, ""honey, let's exchange numbers""
scene 3 - weeks of dating late night conversation
in the crib heart racing, trying to be cool and patient
she touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
she walked away smiling, singing gregory isaacs
like, ""if i don't, if i don't have you""
showing me her tan line and her tattoo
playing sade, sweetest taboo
burning candles, all my other plans got cancelled
man i smashed it like a idaho potato
she call me at my j.o., come now, i can't say no
ginseng tree trunks, rocking the p-funk
cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up
three months, she call i feel i'm running a fever
six months, i'm telling her i desperately need her
nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
i need more than to knock it down, i'm really trying to lock it down
midnight we hook up and go at it
burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart i got to have it
she telling me commitment is something she can't manage
wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic
ahh, damn it, my shit is on harrison ford frantic
my 911's unanswered by my fly taurus enchantress
next week, mu hit me up, i saw sharice at the kittie club
with some banging ass asian playing lay it down and lick me up

i can't talk to my mother so i talk to my diary
i'm going off on the deep end
i found myself face-to-face with myself while i'm sleeping
i see your picture in my head and my hands shake
you can run, you can hide but there's no escape
my inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
i got to get this mutherfucker fore he gets to me
so in your own blood, you'll bathe
and i won't stop until i put this motherfucker in his fucking grave
and i can say this once again
you can cry but you'll still die
they'll be no tears in the end

Playaz Club,Rappin' 4-Tay,hiphop,"

[chorus]
me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
we chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the playaz club
check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the playaz club

[verse 1]
i got a ho named reel-to-reel
she got a buddy named sp-12, now you know the deal
we gets freaky in the studio late-night
that's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight
somethin' to roll to, somethin' to stroll to
if you's a player in the game this'll hold you
more money, more money for the bank roll
stick to the script, don't slip in the '94
a lot of fools put the salt in the game
to where these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
huh, i run my own, and i'm my own self-person
no respect make the situation worsen
fillmore, h.p., and sunnydale
there's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
lakeview, p.h., and army street
a different part of town, a different kind of freak
i just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
and press play on remote at the playaz club

[chorus]
me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
we chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the playaz club
check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the playaz club
(more champagne, mr. forté?)

[verse 2]
from day one i had to get my money right
me, fly, and frankie j, we took an airplane flight
huh, they wanted to hear a rap, i said ""alright, bet""
we dropped a beat, i grabbed the mic, and then they wrote a check
a few g's for the pocket, no hesitation
took a flight back to the golden state, and
shops made orders from a whole new capital
the word was gettin' out, 4-tay's out-rappable
don't need a glock, but i bought one just in case
a sucka try to stop me from pursuing my paper chase
know the chase is on, because it don't stop
i got the beat and got the rap, you make the glock pop
so treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
by the way, just in case you never heard of rappin' 4-tay
i'm on the smooth tip
never trippin' on them suckas poppin' off at the lip
i pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank, bro
leave the gat at the house, bring some dominoes
kick off your shoes, relax, and get a body rub
and shoot your mackin' at these women at the playaz club

[chorus]
me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
we chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the playaz club
check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the playaz club

[verse 3]
you can't resist it, but don't get it twisted
vip, that means the number's not listed
membership is based on clout
and how you carry yourself; now homie, what you all about?
i stack paper and kick it with the o.g.'s
some got a nine-to-five, some took a lot of kis
you can learn a whole lot from a playa
a lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme-sayer
a lot of people get a misconception
and start drifting in the wrong direction
miss goody two-shoe, i'll see you later
i ain't got time, you ain't nothing but a playa-hater
i'd rather kick it with the crew in arizona
they chop game like we do in california
another show, another flow, a new bank account
but cash money comes in large amounts
so get your membership, but never slip to lameness fast
or else fly will have to tap that ass
and drop you to the ground, and make your knees scrub
it's just an everyday thang at the playaz club

[chorus]
me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
we chop a lot of game, that's how we do it in the playaz club
check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the playaz club
me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
we chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the playaz club
check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the sucka-free club

[outro: rappin' 4 tay & lil fly]
yeah, i'd like to send this shout out
to all the playaz clubs throughout the world

Gettin' It,Too $hort,hiphop,"

[intro: too $hort]
that's right, album number ten, short dawg's in the house
it's gettin close to the end y'all
but we gonna kick it like this on the last album

[verse 1: too $hort]
now let me holler at ya partner, spit this game
in your ear for a minute, quit complainin'
'bout how you can't spend it 'cause you ain't got it
you got what it takes but not enough to get started
i hope you get the message, no it's not a test it's
just me ridin legit, they can't arrest me or bust me
i'm still hungry, i want some more stuff
get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
so get yours, and buy my new album
peep the game and don't be like calvin
get everything you want, get real, get your mail
get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jail
you should be gettin it, everything you want
everything you dreamed of, never have to front
you should be gettin it, gettin money
i'm talking bout you black, don't laugh it ain't funny
you should get a good lawyer, like johnnie cochran
swear to tell the truth, 'hell nah i didn't pop him'
get your kids in school so they can get an education
get a degree, and take a vacation
you see i got all my game from the streets of california
young millionaire with no high school diploma
livin real good, taking care of my folks
roll up a fat one for the players to smoke
short dog's in the house, i know you ain't trippin'
'cause life is too $hort, you gotta get in where you fit in
stop looking for what you never seem to find
it ain't what you think, you got to read between the lines
'cause life ain't long for a young black man
tryin' to make money doing all he can
sellin' dope, don't ya hope he would go to class
but the boy makes money and he makes it fast
with the twenties on top and the fifties on bottom
a flock a top notches, oh yes, we got 'em
it's been a long time since i first got down
but i still keep makin' these funky sounds

[refrain]
get your money, mayne
get yours

[chorus (x4)]
you should be gettin' it
get it while the gettin' is good, get it while you can
you should be gettin' it
get it while the gettin' is good

[refrain]
get your money, mayne
get yours
you should be gettin' it

[verse 2: too $hort]
i know you tired of bein' broke, just hangin' out
you gotta lot a dreams but you can't get out
the first thing you need to do is set yourself some goals
think positive, everything else is old
and work hard, never stop hustlin'
'cause they just love to see the black man strugglin'
(so what are you sayin', todd?)
it's time to come up, put your dollar bills in the air
he said meet me at the white house and i was there
'cause i'm one in a million, black men risin'
they wanna keep me down but i always surprise 'em
spend my money in the 'hood, i know it's all good
and you should do the same, i told you peep the game
from too $hort, you know i'm the man
i lend my brother a hand 'cause i know i can
i keep goin' and goin' but i'm not the pink bunny
instead of beatin' on the drum, i never stop thinking money
i'm gettin' all i can, if you don't, ya slip
i can't wait to get to heaven just to have a grip
when i was broke, i couldn't afford a meal
but now i'm now rich, i can't be fake, i gots to keep it real
it's been a long time baby since i first got down
but it still keep makin' these funky sounds

[chorus]

[outro (x2)]
i earned my respect in the street
the ghetto's been good to me
i'm never going to turn my back
the true and living so i gots to kick the facts

Sing For The Moment,Eminem,hiphop,"

[verse 1: eminem]
these ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing
it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (bitch!)
'cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
he sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
his step-father hit him so he socked him back
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home
there's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[chorus: steven tyler (& eminem)]
(come on!) sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

[verse 2: eminem]
entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
in the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
holy or unholy, only have one homie
only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
yet everybody just feels like they can relate (huh-uh)
i guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
it's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
from standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
to havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
but then these critics crucify you (yep), journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
that's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
but all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
so i'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me
they're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
if i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, b
it's all political, if my music is literal
and i'm a criminal, how the fuck can i raise a little girl?
i couldn't, i wouldn't be fit to
you're full of shit too, guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (bitch!)

[chorus: steven tyler (& eminem)]
(come on!) sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (sing that shit!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

[verse 3: eminem]
they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
see, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
and they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
we entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
you ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
we just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
it's fucked up, ain't it? how we can come from practically nothin'
to bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (ha-ha!)
who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
so they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
we're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
that's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…

[chorus: steven tyler (& eminem)]

and i'm smoking junior m.a.f.i.a in front of you nigga

i got a team of simple bout-able souls
move my ears like yoda, quick as a cobra and never sober

[verse 5: kadafi]
i'm on a 12 o' clock cruise to brooklyn and i'm looking
for the thrill to see in your barrel ready to get his life token

leave your coward ass stripped and a full clip empty in your stomach
choosin' all, yeah nigga run it
dropping all you cowards that be jackin' a nigga behind him

The Formula,The D.O.C.,hiphop,"

[verse 1: the d.o.c.]
high energy flowin' with the wisdom
sense of a rich man, knowledge and the rhythm
this is what i'm using to come up with a style
so i'll interact altogether better with the crowd
nervous for a second then the record starts spinnin'
and i fall into the state of mind of what i'd just created
pump it like the dr. d into the r.e. suckers ready to leap
up on the tip when we made it
creative so i'll never be regarded as a regular
more than just a little bit better than my competitor
you should never underestimate the fashion
i hold for the stage whether i'm coolin' or thrashin''
clockin' the concoction created by me
when read you read e = the d.o. to the c
knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
equals an artist that won't be worn, what is that dre?

[dr. dre]
it's the formula

[verse 2: the d.o.c.]
it's like a message that only i could understand
but those who want to comprehend will again
be in the midst of the brother
unlike another in any way
cause dre don't play, say what the other say
originality is a must whenever i bust
a funky composition, it's crush and i trust that you
know it when you hear a funky record with potential
me gettin' hype cause dre rockin' the instrumental
nothing like what you've heard before and more, never less
see i don't fess, i mean i'm like fresh if not the freshest
when i'm expressin' my thoughts on
vinyl, you can't help but listen up and get caught on
hooked because i cook when i pick up a pen
and begin, in the end it's dope, that's cause i want to win
knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
equals the doc, what is it dre?

[dr. dre]
yo, man, that's the formula

[verse 3: the d.o.c.]
keepin' it dope as long as i can like imagine
makin' each record that i do better than the last one
take a little time, choose the topic and drop it
release it, the science of makin' dope beats with
rhythmic american poetry
shipped it to stations, now many people know of me
i'm the d. into the o. and the o. into the c. and the c. into the period
suckers are fearin' this
when heard, the dope style calculated by the great wait
and take just a second to get caught up in my record
new but not a kid to be worn
if something gettin' torn up then i'm doin' the
tearin', not bein' torn
shapin' up to be one for the top vocalist lyricist
and when you hear of this
you shouldn't choke on this
knowledge and the talent makes it valid
for me to get it patented
dre, tellin' what i'm rappin'

[dr. dre]
the formula

[verse 4: the d.o.c.]
in effect and i'm smooth, that's why i'm on the incline
suckers frontin' for nothin' cause i'm goin' to get mine
it's in the cards and i think i might have read this
so don't lie and try to front like someone said this
most who know thoughts served by the doc see
that it's a mission impossible, tryin' to rock me
for an arena who'd ask me to perform for her
g.o. and easily i flow and ya know usin' the formula

guess it's true what they tellin' me
fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity

"Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Cant Have None) (feat. Nate Dogg, Warren G & Kurupt)",Snoop Dogg,hiphop,"

[intro: ricky harris]
you're back now at the jack-off hour
this is dj ez dicc
on wballz
right now, something new by snoop doggy dogg
and this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
a big bow-wow-wow
'cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
this is dj ez dicc
on the station that slaps you across your fat ass with a fat dick

[verse 1: nate dogg]
when i met you last night, baby
before you opened up your gap
i had respect for you, lady
but now, i take it all back
'cause you gave me all your pussy
and you even licked my balls
leave your number on the cabinet
and i promise, baby, i'll give you a call
next time i'm feeling kinda horny
you can come on over
and i'll break you off
and if you can't fuck that day, baby
just lay back and open your mouth
'cause i have never met a girl
that i love in the whole wide world

[verse 2: kurupt]
well if kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, i'd always be broke
i'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke
i gets loc'ed and loony, bitch, you can't do me
do we look like bbd? you hoochie groupie
i have no love for hoes
that's something that i learned in tha pound
so how the fuck am i supposed
to pay this hoe just to lay this hoe?
i know the pussy's mines
so i'mma fuck a couple more times
and then i'm through with it
there's nothing else to do with it
pass it to the homie, now you hit it
cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
and y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
i gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?
approach her with a different proposition
i'm kurupt, ho, you'll never be my only one trick-ass bitch!

[hook: nate dogg]
it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

[verse 3: snoop dogg]
guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house?
with a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth
hoes recognize, niggas do too
'cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
what you gon' do? you really don't know
so i'd advise you not to trust that ho
silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
knowing damn well i'm too caught up with my grip
now, as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
how many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named snoop?
doggy, i'm all the above
i'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
but see it ain't no fun
if my homies can't get a taste of it
'cause you know i don't love em

[verse 4: warren g]
woo! hey, now you know
inhale, exhale with my flow
one for the money, two for the bitches
three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
in my chevy, '64—red, to be exact
with bitches on my side and bitches on my back
so back up, bitch, because i'm struggling
just get on your knees and then start juggling
these motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
it's me, warren g, the nigga with the clout

[hook: nate dogg]
it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

Liquid Swords,GZA,hiphop,"

[skit: gibran evans]
when i was little, my father was famous
he was the greatest samurai in the empire
and he was the shogun's decapitator
he cut off the heads of a 131 lords
it was a bad time for the empire
the shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
people said his brain was infected by devils
my father would come home, he would forget about the killings
he wasn't scared of the shogun, but the shogun was scared of him
maybe that was the problem
then, one night, the shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
they were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
that was the night everything changed

[intro: rza]
see, sometimes
you gotta flash 'em back
see niggas don't know where this shit started
y'all know where it came from
i'm saying we gonna take y'all back to the source
do the knowledge, yo

[chorus: rza + gza]
when the mcs came to live out the name
and to perform, some had
to snort cocaine to act insane
before pete rocked it on
now on with the mental plane
to spark the brain with the building to be born
yo, rza, flip the track with the what to cut

[verse 1: gza]
fake niggas get flipped in mic fights i swing swords and cut clowns
shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
i flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
on some wild out shit to insert a fiend
but it was your op to shop stolen art
catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
i put mad pressure on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirts
that's minimum and feminine like sandals
my minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
energy is felt once the cards are dealt
with the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
that attack, the mic-phones like cyclones or typhoon
i represent from midnight to high noon
i don't waste ink, nigga, i think
i drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
'cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
do clouds of smoke of natural blends of weed
only under one circumstance that's if i'm blunted
turn that shit up, my clan in da front want it

[chorus]
now when the mcs came to live out the name
and to perform, some had

[verse 2: gza]
i'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
but when i swing my swords they all choppable
i be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
child educator, plus head amputator
'cause niggas styles are old like mark 5 sneakers
lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
don't even stop in my station and attack
while your plan failed, get derailed like amtrak
what the fuck for? down by law, i make law
i be justice, i sentence that ass two to four
round the clock, that state pen time, check it
but the pens i be sticking with, you can't state the crime
came through with the wu, slid off on the dl
i'm low-key like seashells, i rock these bells
now come aboard, it's medina bound
enter the chamber and it's a whole different sound
it's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
so deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

yeah, you know sometimes i think
they don't truly understand me, you know
cause they don't, yeah, uh

[bridge]
can't change the world unless we change ourselves
die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
all eyes be my witness when i speak what's felt
full house on my hands, the cards i was dealt
three k's, two a's in amerikkka
i'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula
and everything i do or say today that's worthwhile
will for sure inspire actions in your first child
i'll begin my verse now

[verse 1]
sometimes i speak and i feel like it ain't my words
like i'm just a vessel channeling inside this universe
i feel my ancestors unrested inside of me
it's like they want me to shoot my chance in changing society
but how do i go about it? tell me where i start?
my destiny rerouted when i chose to follow heart
you told to follow suit, but tell me what it do for you?
except weigh you down, now you trapped inside the cubicle
they built for us
the first step into change is to take notice
realize the real games that they tried to show us
300 plus years of them cold shoulders
yet 300 million of us still got no focus
sorry america, but i will not be your soldier
obama just wasn't enough, i need some more closure
and donald trump is not equipped to take this country over
let’s face facts 'cause we know what’s the real motives

[chorus]
in the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
they disorganized my people, made us all loners
still got the last names of our slave owners
in the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
they disorganized my people, made us all loners, yeah

and everything i do or say today is worthwhile

[verse 2]
trickery in the system, put my niggas in prison
all our history hidden, ain't no liberty given
we all fit the description of what the documents written
we been lacking the vision and barely making a living
we too worried to fit in while they been benefitin'
every time you submittin', we all guilty admit it
the lord won't get you acquitted, but you still ask for forgiveness
put opiates in syringes then inject his religion
how many times do i gotta tell you i'm a man on a mission
many times i gotta tell you i don't need no permission
a human with super vision, ain't no livin' condition
i'm reaching out to my children, just hoping that they will listen
start a new coalition against corrupt politicians
it's not enough pots to piss in, too many murder convictions
another family evicted, another black man a victim
that's as real as it's getting, you should take recognition

what i did and what i didn't do for them
bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
droppin' bottles, spend, i'm supplyin' ten
jumpin' out a honda, i just got it in
askin' what i cop, none of your concern
one day you gone learn what you tryna get
everything on sale, goin' out of biz
partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
juggin' round the city, you know what it is
bread winner business, put that on the wrist

[chorus]
i got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
i got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
think i need two more, line bumpin’ i’m ring, ring, ringin’
countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
trap jumpin' i’m ring, ring, ringin’
i got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
i got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
think i need two more, line bumpin’ i’m ring, ring, ringin’
countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
trap jumpin' i’m ring, ring, ringin’

[verse 3]
ring, ring, ringin' man
find me balling hard
come from grinding hard
getting calling cards from your barbie doll
when she round me she know i'm her bodyguard
money callin' for me, baby girl i'm sorry
you just high yella you not that important
weight, shape her, i could pin you to the carpet
smell like tartar, i'ma put you in the water
conversation cost a lot of chips
she don't really get a lot of this
engagin' where i'm gazin' at her hips
and ain't nobody makin' no attempts
amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
maybe we can make it takin' trips
maybe i was thinkin' too impatient
phone ringing, hold up, what it is?

[chorus]
i got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
i got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
think i need two more, line bumpin’ i’m ring, ring, ringin’
countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
trap jumpin' i’m ring, ring, ringin’
i got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
i got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough

1942 Flows,Meek Mill,hiphop,"

[verse 1]
started off poor with plans to own more
now we own stores and fuck the baddest whores
i was on tour with niggas that sold raw
started sellin' white, we won't sell it no more
i'm like, trump ain't feelin' us, cops still killin' us
niggas takin' shots, can't stop me, they ain't real enough
cut her off, act like she's dead and it's killin' her
new dawn, hermes seat, i let the ceiling up
just to kill 'em softly, ooh, get 'em off me
try to crucify me like i'm jesus the way she cross me
i'm too bossy and too thorough
to move like a weirdo, on point like an arrow
we started off with zero, now i'm seein' m's
diamonds like water and they jumpin' out the gym
shootin' like harden if your head was the rim
'cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim, damn
back when i was broke, they was cool with it
now every move i make i'm in the news with it
even if i ain't do it they be like ""you did it!""
my teacher always used to tell me ""you gon' lose nigga!""
that's why i never went to school nigga
and why i'm rappin' like i got somethin' to prove nigga
went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
billy with the stamp, i get two with it
move with it 'cause these niggas wanna take my life
no weapon formed against me every time i pray at night
scoopin' thotties in the phantom, that's the way of life
and make 'em fuck their best friends like they was dykes
reachin' for the glock every time i play the light
i'm on 12 o'clock every time i play them bikes
i'm with the pack, uh, gettin' back, yeah
spendin' dope, nigga, sellin' smack, gang
i'm gettin' chips off music like rap snacks
yeah, 10 mil in cash of ethika, that's a fact
money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet
i know these niggas upset, they ain't see me fall yet
wins and losses!

[chorus]
they wanna see me fall
and i will never sell my soul
i'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
i don't need these whores
i'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
play with me, you know it's all-out war
the young niggas goin' all out for us

[verse 2]
bloggers in a frenzy, truck to the bentley
ain't doin' no interviews, i'm busy, nigga we litty
so when you see me out don't ask me about no nicki
fuck i look like tellin' my business on wendy
niggas gossip like queens, we was servin' fiends
.40 bust your windows out: jazmine sullivan
they told 'em pop mollys, i told 'em to be kings
sippin' 1942 like it's lean
i done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams
so i'ma give it to 'em every time i'm on the scene
pull up ghost ghost, wraith wraith when you see me
some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
i know it, i go through it, don't show it
i told niggas who wrote it, ain't takin' back what i quoted
started off with a quarter, flipped that to a half
turned that to an ounce, got some shit in the stash
nigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass
now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
and one thing 'bout meek milly, i'ma get to a bag
had to starve all day just to get to it fast
like ramadan, totin' k's like it's palestine
real niggas in my ambiance, bottom line
ever since i met ross and signed the dotted line
i gave my momma 10,000 at least a thousand times
do the math on it!

[chorus]
they wanna see me fall
and i will never sell my soul
i'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
i don't need these whores
i'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
play with me, you know it's all-out war
the young niggas goin' all out for us

[verse 3]
talkin', this my cocky flow
damn daniel, why you son him? mr miyagi though
this that rose gold patek, call me like '94
mean nothin' to me, i tell you how it gotta go
rain, sleet, on that corner when the block was slow
everybody was tryna trap, we started poppin' though
heard that bitch say she cut me, i was like ""¡adiós!""
in the field, knock 'em down, it look like dominoes
young nigga, i turned my impala to a wraith
when you get a dollar they gon' hate
bought my mom the crib with that gate
private school for all them babies, now they straight, nigga

[chorus]
they wanna see me fall
and i will never sell my soul
i'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
i don't need these whores
i'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
play with me, you know it's all-out war
the young niggas goin' all out for us

Once an Addict - Interlude,J. Cole,hiphop,"

[intro]
right, right, right, right
something's got a hold on me
right, right, right, right
sometimes i think pain is just a lack of understanding
if we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
god must feel no pain
something's got a hold on me
only joy
does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

[verse]
lost in a cloud of marijuana
young carolina nigga, fish out of water
step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
mama ain't recover yet
callin' me at 12 at night
she drunk as fuck and i'm upset
'cause why she always using me for crutch?
growin' up i used to always see her up
late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from marvin gaye
she kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
i gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when i see her like this
too young to deal with pain
i'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
so 'ville became my escape from a feelin' i hate
mama cursing me out
depression's such a villainous state
i used to stay out later on purpose
subconsciously i was nervous that if i came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
and then i'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
tears flow while al green blow
love and happiness
i wish that i could say the right words to cheer her up
i wish her son's love was enough
i tell her, ""mama, go to sleep""
she tell me ""boy, hush. you better pray to god you never get your heart crushed""
i shake my head in frustration
head to my room and i can still hear the tunes with my door shut
fuck it though, a couple more months i'll be gone
off to college and dorms
foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
but now it's 1 am and my mama dialin' my phone
i know she intoxicated and soon this high that i'm on comes crashin' down
she lit, talkin' drunk shit, i'm pissed
but i'm still all ears like basset hounds
thinkin' to myself, ""maybe my mama need help
don't she got work in the morning?
why she do this to herself?
hate how she slurrin' her words
soundin' so fuckin' absurd
this ain't the woman i know, why i just sit and observe?
why don't i say how i feel?
when i do, she's defensive for real
well maybe things get better with time, i heard it heals
little did i know how deep her sadness would go
lookin' back, i wish i woulda did more instead of runnin'

[outro]
something's got a hold on me
i can't let it go
out of fear i won't be free
something's got a hold on me
i can't let it go
out of fear i won't be—
no!
something's got a hold on me
i can't let it go
right
life can bring much pain
there are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
choose wisely (right)

tell me what do you see, when you're looking at me
on a mission to be, what i'm destined to be
i've done been through the pain and the sorrow
the struggle it's nothing but love
i'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above
all the above (x7)

[verse one: maino]
listen! really what do you see, when you looking at me?
see me come up from nothing, see me living my dreams
i've done been through the bottom, i've done suffered a lot
i deserve to be rich, heading straight to the top
look how i ride for the block, look how i rep for the hood
i got nothing but love, now that i come through the hood
getting this fortune and fame, money make all of us change
the new benz is all white, call it john mccain
how the hell could you stop me? why in the world would you try?
i go hard forever, that's just how i'm designed
that's just how i was built, see the look in my eyes
you take all of this from me, and i'm still gon' survive
you get truth from me, but these rappers gon' lie
i'm a part of these streets, till the day that i die
i wave hi to the haters, mad that i finally done made it
take a look, and you can tell that i'm destined for greatness

[hook: t-pain]

[verse two: maino]
it's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
put your foot in my nike's, picture you living my life
picture you stuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life
picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
i perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
you've been seeing me lately, i'm a miracle baby
i refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
i put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow
when i think that i can't, i envision obama
i envision in diamonds, i envision ferrari's
if the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
ain't you happy i made it? man i'm making a statement
take a look, and you can tell that i'm destined for greatness

what's the commotion, yo i'm not joking around

darling, i told you many times
and i am telling you once again
just to remind you, sweetheart
that my—

[verse: kendrick lamar]
oh, lamar
hail mary and marijuana, times is hard
pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
fellowship with demons and relatives, i'm a star
life is one funny mothafucka
a true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
i might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
see, once upon a time inside the nickerson garden projects
the object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
anthony was the oldest of seven
well-respected, calm and collected
laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
a four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
his family history: pimpin' and bangin'
he was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
even got some head from a smoker last weekend
dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
that was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
he beat the case and went back to hustlin'
bird-shufflin', anthony rang
the first in the projects with the two-tone mustang, that 5.0 thing they say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
and hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
crooked cops told anthony he should kick it
he brushed 'em off and walked back to the kentucky fried chicken
see, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
with a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
his name was ducky, he came from the streets, the robert taylor homes
southside projects, chiraq, the terror dome
drove to california with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
they had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
cadillac seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'cross the street from the projects, anthony planned to rob it
stuck up the place before, back in '84
that's when affiliation was really at gears of war
so many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
ducky was well-aware
they robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
he figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
free chicken every time anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
in fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
that one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
reverse the manifest and good karma, and i'll tell you why
you take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
because if anthony killed ducky, top dawg could be servin' life
while i grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

yeah i'ma get this one off for 87th street
south side of chicago, chicago everywhere, check it
it's like come on, y'all, get live, get down
common sense is in your town
i said come on, y'all, get live, get down
common sense is in your town

[verse 1]
i stagger in the gatherin', possessed by a patter-in that be scatterin'
over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen
it's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine
i grab the men, verbally badgering broads
i wish that madelyne was back on video lp
i went against all odds and got a even steven
proceed to read and not believin' everything i'm readin'
but my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise
i didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
i analyze where i rest my eyes
and chastise the best of guys with punchlines
i'm nestle when it's crunch-time
for your mind like one time
if poetry was pussy i'd be sunshine
'cause i deliver like the sun-times
confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes i combine
i'm hype like i'm unsigned, my diet i un-swine
eating beef sometimes -- i try to cut back on that shit
this rap shit is truly outta control
my style is too developed to be arrested
it's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
they tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so i would sell
i bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
a mr. meaner fell on his knee for the jury
i asked no for his id and the judge thought there was two of me
motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
they relinquished sense, 'cause i was guilty in a sense

[scratched hook]
""resurrection""

[verse 2]
i ride the rhythm like a schwinn bike when in dim light
i use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
i send light, like ben's kite, i've been bright
get open like on gym nights and in fights i send rights
don't hook with skins my friends like, i spend nights up in dykes
in spite, i've been indicted as a freak of all trades
(doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo) i got it made
i bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
come from a tribe of bums hooked on negro and mums
had to halt with the, malt liquor
'cause off the malt liquor, i fought niggas
now my speech and thoughts quicker
cruise the southside streets with no heat and no sticker
uac got my back and we don't get no thicker
uac got my back and we don't get no thicker
uac got my back and we don't, now check it
i'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
when it's my turn to go, i gotta go
and i'm gone with the storm

with your hands out for my money, man, how much can i take?
when these streets keep callin', heard it when i was sleep
that this gay-z and cock-a-fella records wanted beef

to explode it on a camel and his soldiers
i can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid

you seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
were you abused as a child?
scared to smile? they called you ugly?
well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
in '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
callin' my crib and i ain't even give you my numbers
all i did was give you a style for you to run with
smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the god
wearin' jaz' chains, no tec's, no cash, no cars
no jail bars, jigga, no pies, no case
just hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little chase
you a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a stan

nah, i'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
that ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow

and that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?

guess who's back, guess who's back
guess who's back, guess who's back
guess who's back, guess who's back
guess who's back

[verse 1: eminem]
i've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
see marshall no more, they want shady, i'm chopped liver
well, if you want shady, this is what i'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
than a shock when i get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when i'm not co-operating
when i'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)
you waited this long, now stop debating
‘cause i'm back, i'm on the rag and ovulating
i know that you got a job, ms. cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating
so the fcc won't let me be
or let me be me, so let me see
they try to shut me down on mtv
but it feels so empty without me
so, come on and dip, bum on your lips
fuck that! cum on your lips and some on your tits
and get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, debbie!

[chorus: eminem]
now this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
‘cause we need a little controversy
‘cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
‘cause we need a little controversy
‘cause it feels so empty without me

[verse 2: eminem]
little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis
they start feeling like prisoners helpless
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""bitch!""
a visionary, vision is scary
could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
a rebel, so just let me revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
and it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
well, i'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then i'm gonna
enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention, back for the winter
i'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
testing, ""attention please""
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
a nuisance, who sent? you sent for me?

[chorus: eminem]
now this looks like a job for me

anybody who's talking ""this shit, that shit""
chris kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little limp bizkit bastards
and moby? you can get stomped by obie
you 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
you don't know me, you're too old, let go
it's over, nobody listens to techno
now let's go, just give me the signal
i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol
but sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm disgusting
but it's just me, i'm just obscene
though i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy (hey!)
there's a concept that works
twenty million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
it'd be so empty without me

[chorus: eminem]
now this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
‘cause we need a little controversy

lodi dodi, we likes to party
we don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
we're just some niggas who're on the mic
and when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic (right)
for all my doggs keepin' y'all in health
just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
cause it's cool when you cause the cozy condition in
which we create, cause that's our mission
so listen close, to what we say
because this types of shit happens every day
i woke up around 10 o'clock in the morning
i gave myself a stretch, up, a morning yawn, and
went to the bathroom to wash up
i threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
and said ""um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
who is the top dog of them all?""
there was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
the mirror said, ""you are, you conceited bastard!""
well that's true! that's why we never have no beef
so i slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
used oil of olay cause my skin gets pale
and then i got the file for my fingernails
i'm true to the style on my behalf
i put some bubbles in the tub so i can take a bubble bath
clean, dry, was my body and hair
i threw on my brand new doggy underwear
for all the bitches i might take home
i got the johnson's baby powder and cool water cologne
now i'm fresh, dressed like a million bucks
threw on my white socks, with my all-blue chucks
stepped out the house, stopped short, ""oh no""
i went back in, ""i forgot my indo!""
then i dilly (dally) i ran through a (alley)
i bumped into this smoker named (sally) from the (valley)
this was a girl playing hard to get
so i said ""what's wrong?"" cause she looked upset
she said um:

[bridge: nancy fletcher]
it's all because of you, i'm feeling sad and blue
you went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
i love you so, how much you'll never know
cause you took your dope away from me

[verse 2: snoop dogg]
damn, now what was i to do?
she's crying over me and she was feelin blue
i said, ""um, don't cry, dry your eye
and here comes your mother with those two little guys""
her mean mother steps then says to me ""hi!""
decked sally in the face and punched her in the eye
punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
slammed the child on the hard concrete
the bitch was strong, the kids was gone
something was wrong i said, ""what was goin on?""
i tried to break it up, i said, ""stop it, just leave her!""
she said, ""if i can't smoke none, she can't either!""
she grabbed me closely by my socks
and so i broke the hell out, and i grabbed my sack of rocks
but um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
they started crying on my shoes and grabbin' my dick

and saying ""why don't you give me a play
so we can break it down the long beach way
and if you give me that okay
i'll give you all my love today
doggy, doggy, doggy, can't you see?
somehow your words just hypnotize me
and i just love your jazzy ways
doggy dogg, your love is here to stay""

and on and on and on she kept goin'
the bitch been around before my mother's born!
i said ""cheer up!"" and i gave her a hit
i said, ""you can't have me, i'm too young for you bitch!""
she said, ""no you're not!"" then she starts cryin'
i says i'm 19, she says, ""stop lyin!""
i says, ""i am, go ask my mother
and with your wrinkled pussy, i can't be your lover""

[outro: snoop dogg]
yeah, uh, tick-tock ya don’t stop
and to the, uh, tick-tock n'ya don’t quit
yeah, n'ya tick-tock ya don’t stop
and to the, uh, tick-tock n'ya don’t quit
biatch!

Do Not Disturb,Drake,hiphop,"

[background: snoh aalegra]
silence keeps cloudin' me
hand on my heart
and i, i wish time never mattered

[verse: drake]
yeah, stylin’ though
dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
all the things you need, you still want problems though
all the things i know, i still been silent though
yeah, used to be at silvercity, indigo
used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
i don't want to have to go to funerals
i gotta start sleepin' at the studio
i don't have no time to be no romeo
all the love i need is at the rodeo
all the love i need is here at ovo, yeah
all the girls i know are there with e and tho
who knows where i end up when that shit gets old?
maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
last table left in carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
i take a glass of domina to go with me home
might move our annual shit to the 'dome
i need 40,000 people to see what i'm on
yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
i was an angry yute when i was writin’ views
saw a side of myself that i just never knew
i’ll probably self-destruct if i ever lose, but i never do
steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and i open up like a double click
more blessings because i'm generous
thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
remember when i bought sealey the fake chanel wallet
she knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
scary whenever i close my eyes at night
wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
i can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
but you can rest assured that my mind is right
get no sick days, i leave for like three months in six days
never stick around to see shit change
get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
seasons go by like i'm binge-watchin'
went from club palazzo in the bridge to club liv
to not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
i can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
especially people that want to lecture me
and frame it like they just want the best for me
or they check for me, whatever splits it up
so there's more for them and there's less for me
they don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
no one's done it successfully
7am in germany, can't believe that they heard of me
last verse that i gotta do is always like surgery
always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
that's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
last chance i get to make sure that you take it personally
take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
if we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
you overnight celebrity, you one day star
swear i told you that i'm in this bitch for eternity
i am a reflection of all of your insecurities
behind closed doors, a lot of 6 god worshipping
done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
there's real ones around me
i want to make sure they learn from me
i want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
he can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
my life is centered 'round competition and currency
takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me i need recovery
maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
i'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
more life

got a reputation for yourself now
everybody knows and i feel left out

doing things i taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
you don't need no one else
you don't need nobody else, no
why you never alone?
why you always touching road?

[verse]
yeah
my mind state feel like the crime in the summertime
higher than average, lot of cabbage
thank god i never abide by the established
guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
commissioned by the state, i skate by the masters
like ""yoo-hoo"" with a new-new ridin' passenger
shout out oak cliff, i'm 'bout to fly to dallas
decade from now, i might just buy the mavericks
what up, mark cuban?, i am only part human
half-man, half-amazing, plus, i'm good at math like i'm asian
hate to use stereotypes
but that's light compared to what a nigga get from caucasians
no race-baitin'—treat the beat like playstation
reporting to you live from the international space station
i probably vacation on mars
the flow is out of this world and so is the bars
blow the facade right off of your squad
lil' rappers, i love you, but you ain't shit 'til you got offers in prague
look that shit up, a book, nigga, pick that shit up
expand your vocab, i'm giving out toe tags for no cash
all summer long plus three seasons after
please cc a rapper, tell him meet me
it's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
the problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
i'm the answer on the low, i'm a cheat sheet for rappers
i came up 'round ac to dc adapters
plug talk, what i'm really sayin' is a shame but
my niggas move 'caine like hbcu kappas
whole town full of cc sabathia's
you think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack? not really
this is not the eighties, don't be silly
now we push pills and sell heroin to billy
now billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
how many black addicts that got caught up in the system?
with no sob stories on your prime time television
i can smell a blatant contradiction, man, listen
don't want to fuck up my vibe
let's end it on a positive note, come see me live
kod—album of the year, undebatably
my cadence be the greatest we've seen
since the late mc whose name was the
notorious—dreamville stacked like the warriors
winning back to back, next up to bat
is my nigga bas, after that, jiddy-j.i.d
that's that new york city kid, plus atl
me, i'm from the 'ville, but i know them towns well
before i had a deal, i was givin' niggas hell
now i'm givin' niggas deals and they givin' niggas hell

i wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
did this before, promised myself i'd be a hour early
room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
fumbled my jewelry, 100k, i lost a new chain
hop on the bird, hit the next city for another m
take me a nap then do it again
we all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
all of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep
none of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
time passing, things change
reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
lust

[bridge: kendrick lamar]
lately, i feel like i been lusting over the fame
lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
lately (lately) lately, my lust been heightened (lately)
lately, it's all contradiction (lately, i'm not here)
lately, i lust over self (lust turn into fear)
lately, in james 4:4 says
""friend of the world is enemy of the lord""
brace yourself: lust is all yours

poisonous paragraphs smash your phonograph in half

first class, leavin' mics with a cast
causin' ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
run fast, here comes the verbal assaulter
rhymes runnin' wild like a child in a walker
i scored from the inner slums abroad
and my thoughts are razor sharp, i slice the mic from the cord
first to criticize, but now they have become
mentally paralyzed with hits that i devise
now i testify, the best is i
rebel ins, your highness, blessed to electrify
with voltage of a eel, truth that i reveal
will crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real
caesar black down, hoodied up in fatigues
part time minor leagues receive third degrees
attack like a wolf pack once i pull back
the god-u and bust through like a fullback

[verse 2: ghostface killah]
yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
tappin' inside my rap vein causes blizzards
the wildlife that kills for ice trife like by the digits
gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets

let my peeps in, niggas gaspin', swallowin' aspirins
with a dosage, you overdosed in rap
high explosives, my posters hypnotize with hypnosis
i sell goods, my whole clan is on the run like natural born killers
record-breakin' the album thriller
got access to tear gas, bombs and rocket launchers
flow like dough, killa beez is what i sponsor
your entrepreneur, pens and gear like shakespeare
when i fuck, i grab hair, collect drawers as souvenirs
fuck yeah, my crew down german beers
my career's based on guns throwin' cats in wheelchairs
et cetera, damage any lame-ass competitor
who try to front, get broken in fast like leathers
whatever, hot hard-heads get shattered like mirrors
beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter your feathers
say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
flew my family overseas, i'm maxin'
if rap was crack, fully packed, i'd be tall caps
taxin' kingpin of the rap drug traffickin'

tie up your black nikes and tight hats

peace to jail niggas with charges
unify layin' in the yard with la

and it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
verbally, i catch bodies with cordless shotties
intriguin' mcs, i keep 'em trained like potties
i bomb facts, my sword is an ax to split backs
visible, like dope fiend tracks
sky's the limit, niggas are timid

don't sweat the technique
don't sweat the technique

[verse 1]
let's trace the hits and check the file
let's see who bit to detect the style
i flip the script so they can't get foul
at least not now, it'll take a while
i change the pace to complete the beat
i drop the bass 'til mcs get weak
for every word they trace, it's a scar they keep
'cause when i speak, they freak to sweat the technique
i made my debut in '86
with a melody and a president's mix
and now i stay on target and refuse to miss
and i still make hits with beats
parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
my underground sound vibrates the streets
mcs wanna beef, then i play for keeps
when they sweat the technique

[hook]
don't sweat the technique
don't sweat the technique

but researchers never found all the pieces yet
scientists try to solve the context
philosophers are wondering what's next
pieces are took to labs to observe 'em
they couldn't absorb 'em, they didn't deserve 'em
my ideas are only for the audience's ears
for my opponents, it might take years
pencils and pens are swords
letters put together from a key to chords
i'm also a sculpture, formed with structure
because of my culture, i'm equipped to construct the
technical styles that'll be full of technology
complete sights and new heights after i get deep
you don't have to speak, just seek
and peep the technique

[hook]
never sweat the technique

[verse 3]
i speak indiscreet 'cause talk is cheap
then i get deep in the beat then complete the
poem's physique, never weak or obsolete
they never grow old, techniques become antiques
better then something brand new 'cause it's real
and in a while the style’ll have much more value
classical, too intelligent to be radical
masterful, never irrelevant, mathematical
here's some soothing souvenirs
for all the years, you fought and sought the thoughts and ideas
it's cool when you freak to the beat
but don't sweat the technique

[hook]
never sweat the technique
don't sweat the technique
don't sweat the technique

51. upon information and belief, after obtaining copies of and/or listening to “the thorn”, one or all of the defendants created a sound recording titled “rigamortus”, which was a track on lamar’s
section.80 (topdawg).

52. “rigamortus” is a hip-hip recording consisting entirely of the refrain from “the thorn” sound recording with lyrics added and performed by lamar.

53. “the thorn” is not merely a part of “rigamortus” or even the heart of “rigamortus”; it is “rigamortus”. the distinctive and catchy refrain from “the thorn” sound recording, sped up a bit, repeats as a continuous loop throughout the entire “rigamortus” song while lamar raps over it. the clever melodic triplets, infectious rhythm, and commanding horns from “the thorn” are copied to “rigamortus” directly from jones’ sound recording. defendants did not play any instruments or contribute any original musical performance to the “rigamortus” sound recording. the instrumental element of “rigamortus” and the composition that it embodies are owned and authored entirely by jones and reed respectively.

54. the lyrics to “rigamortus” and the performance thereof are the only elements of “rigamortus” not copied directly from “the thorn”.

57. “rigamortus (remix)” is nearly identical to “rigamortus”, containing the same musical elements from “the thorn” as “rigamortus”, only with additional lyrics performed and  presumably authored by busta rhymes.

58. “rigamortus (remix)” was released as a single by topdawg entertainment.

59. ascap records for “rigamortus (remix)” list only brown as sole author, despite that he contributed no original musical authorship to the work, and the remix is a mere variation of “rigamortus”.

60. upon information and belief, after obtaining copies of and/or listening to “the thorn”, one or all of the defendants created a sound recording titled “rigamortus (full instrumental)” (topdawg).

61. “rigamortus (full instrumental)” was released on ichiban: sound in 3d by defendant, brown (topdawg).

62. “rigamortus (full instrumental)” does not feature lyrics or vocal performances and consists only of the repeating loop that was taken from “the thorn” with minor sonic embellishments and studio sound effects added. authorship in the sound recording and the underlying musical composition belong entirely to reed and jones.
striking similarity of the works61. the tde “rigamortus” songs all consist of the repeating loop of the distinctive and catchy refrain from “the thorn” sound recording.

62. “the thorn” and the tde “rigamortus” songs feature clever melodic triplets, infectious rhythm, and commanding horns.

63. the tde “rigamortus” songs’ striking similarity to “the thorn” is obvious, even to non-musicians. jones and reed became aware of the infringing “rigamortus” through non-musicians who brought the lamar recording to their attention. after performing “the thorn” live at dizzy’s club coca-cola in new york, reed was approached by two separate members of the audience who exclaimed that lamar sampled the song. a high school friend of jones’ saw lamar’s “rigamortus” video, immediately recognized “the thorn”, and contacted jones. the wikipedia page for section.80 states: “ ‘rigamortus’ contains a sample of ‘the thorn’ as  performed by willie jones iii”, and the website found at www.whosampled.com (image below) states that music from “the thorn” appears throughout “rigamortus”, even though lamar’s album does not list “the thorn” or its authors among the album credits.
64. pianist kris bowers covered “rigamortus”, spelling it “rigamortis” and stating that the lamar recording contains music from “the thorn”, written by reed and recorded on jones’ the next phase.

65. all versions of “rigamortus” and “rigamortis”, starting with the tde “rigamortus” songs and including covers, remakes, remixes, and other variations thereof are infringing derivative works adapted from “the thorn”.
access to reed/jones’ “the thorn”66. “the thorn” appeared on the next phase, which was released to the worldwide general public for purchase on july 20, 2010. online retailers itunes, amazon, and cdbaby carried the recording for anyone to purchase.

67. “the thorn” was available for listening via streaming audio on the internet from spotify, rhapsody, pandora, and others on the july 20, 2010 release date.

68. upon information and belief, one or all of the defendants obtained a copy of “the thorn” and copied it in order to make the tde “rigamortus” songs in 2011.

69. neither reed nor jones nor their affiliated companies gave permission to any of the defendants to copy, use, or otherwise exploit any of their music in any form whatsoever. defendants appropriated “the thorn” without the knowledge or consent of the rightful owners of the song and sound recording. defendants did so willfully; fully aware that the music they appropriated was not theirs and that they did not have permission to use it.

69. defendants did not attribute any of the musical element of the tde “rigamortus” songs to reed or jones. no album credit or other acknowledgement was afforded reed and jones for “the thorn”.

69. brown has made it of record that he is an avid listener of jazz and relative of trumpet legend clifford brown.

70. on september 7, 2011, brown contacted reed via facebook and inquired: “i need to ask you a question about sampling ..like if i were to sample your work for a hip hop record.. what would your feelings be about that?”

71. unaware that “the thorn” had already been misappropriated by brown, reed replied by suggesting that they talk in more detail in the future. reed did not consent to the use of any of his music in any part of the exchange with brown.

71. in a video posted to his own youtube channel on september 17, 2011, producer brown demonstrates exactly how he “created” “rigamortus”. the caption on the youtube page lists the following description for the video: “willie b plays the original sample of ‘rigamortus’ and shows the session in fruityloops. #hiiipower.” the video opens with brown addressing viewers and then shifts to his computer from which he plays “the thorn” and the monitor reads: “willie jones iii the thorn”. the entire video is 2:31 in length and no instruments are used. only the computer and the sound recording of “the thorn” are used to create “rigamortus” in less than three minutes.







72. in an interview posted on istandardproducers.com, brown stated that the “rigamortus” instrumental track was something he made in his mother’s back room with his only contribution being production. he went on to say that the track was really for a rap song that he wrote titled “the thorn”.
defendants’ exploitation of “rigamortus” and other infringing derivative works and benefits derived therefrom73. “rigamortus” was released for worldwide purchase via the internet as part of lamar’s acclaimed
section.80 (topdawg).

74. at the time of filing this complaint, plaintiffs are aware of the following versions of the infringing “rigamortus”: “rigamortus”, kendrick lamar:section.80; “rigamortus (remix)”, kendrick lamar featuring busta rhymes; “rigamortus (full instrumental)”, willie b:ichiban: sound in 3d; “rigamortis cover”, kris bowers; “rigamortis”, cgp all stars: all the  kings men; “rigamortis (instrumental)”, syndicate sound labs: kendrick’s instrumentals, vol. 1; “rigamortis”, redd:potential; and “national rigamortis (radiohead x kendrick lamar)”, the b.e.a.t.:undercover ep.

75. all songs listed in the preceding paragraph are being sold, performed, licensed, and otherwise exploited for money by the defendants.

76. the numerous remakes, remixes, and excessive exploitation of “rigamortus” are a testament to the immense popularity of the musical portion of the song. however, they have saturated the airwaves and diminished the market for licensing “the thorn” for use by other  producers.

77. pharrell williams praised lamar as one of the next great hip hop artists, citing rigamortis as a favorite and saying: “i love -- that jazz sh*t”. (the image below is the moment when williams expressed his love of the jazz.) since then, lamar has collaborated with williams on music featured in the soundtrack to the film the amazing spider man 2.

78. lady gaga also is a known fan of lamar’s, tweeting the hashtag #rigamortis on july 4, 2011 before attending his performance at pitchfork music festival in chicago.

79. in an interview posted on hiphopdx.com, brown states that “rigamortus” opened doors for him and “catapulted” his career.

80. as the listed copyright claimants to “rigamortus”, defendants collect and/or are  believed to be entitled to collect royalties and licensing revenue from all exploitation of “rigamortus” including but not limited to remakes, remixes, videos, and streaming.

81. terrence “punch” henderson, co-president of topdawg entertainment told billboard magazine in an interview that appeared in the march 8, 2014 issue that section.80 sold more than 130,000 copies.

fourth claim for relief misappropriation, 36 c.f.r. § 2.30101. plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in  paragraphs 1-100 inclusive, as though fully set forth herein. 102. defendants obtained plaintiffs’ musical performance of “the thorn” and the composition embodied therein, exploited these properties in numerous ways for pecuniary gain and career advancement. defendants neither paid plaintiffs nor offered to pay them. 103. defendants are liable for misappropriation in that they obtained plaintiffs’  property or services without making payment or offering to pay.
fifth claim for relief unjust enrichment104. plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in  paragraphs 1-103 inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

104. defendants enjoyed monetary benefits, artistic accolades, and career amplification at plaintiffs’ expense. by using plaintiffs’ work without permission, payment, or artistic credit to plaintiffs, defendants have enjoyed the financial and career benefits of a hit recording without any of the cost normally associated with such endeavors. defendants did not even incur the usual expense of recording; this cost was borne by wj3 when “the thorn” was recorded.

105. defendants are aware of the benefits they have enjoyed as a direct result of their wrongdoing.
sixth claim for relief diminution of value106. plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in  paragraphs 1-105 inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

107. the numerous versions of “rigamortus” by topdawg artists and their licensees has saturated the airwaves with “the thorn”, thereby diminishing its value. this market saturation has effectively destroyed any opportunity plaintiffs would have had to license “the thorn” to the producer of their choice.

108. artists and producers far more successful than the defendants (such as “happy”  phenom, pharrell williams and pop queen lady gaga) have openly expressed their love of “the thorn” through their praise of the “rigamortus” instrumental. plaintiffs’ opportunity to license “the thorn” for use by artists and/or producers on that level has been eliminated by defendants’ excessive exploitation of the song.

wherefore, reed/soldier’s hymn and jones/wj3 pray as set forth above and for the following relief:

(i) ordering defendants to immediately cease and desist all exploitation of all versions of “rigamortus”/”rigamortis” and their derivatives and remakes and associated audiovisual works;

(ii) ordering the impoundment and destruction of all infringing articles;

(iii) ordering defendants to transfer to plaintiffs all copyrights in “rigamortus”, “rigamortus (remix)”, and “rigamortus (full instrumental)”, including but not limited to copyright in the sound recordings and underlying compositions in all versions of the songs;

(iv) ordering defendants to amend all u.s. copyright registrations, ascap registrations and hfa registrations so that all defendants are removed and replaced by plaintiffs as authors and copyright claimants;

(v) ordering defendants, jointly and severally, to pay plaintiffs damages they have sustained and will sustain, and any income, gains, profits, and advantages obtained by defendants as a result of their wrongful acts alleged hereinabove, in an amount according to  proof but not less than $1,000,000.00;

(vi) full disgorgement of defendants’ profits from the infringement;

(vii) ordering defendants to pay to plaintiffs all royalties earned now and in the future from all versions of “rigamortus”/”rigamortis” without deductions for any expenses or disbursements such as recording costs;

(viii) ordering defendants, jointly and severally, to pay plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs incurred in connection with this action, in an amount which cannot yet be

(ix) ordering defendants, jointly and severally, to pay to plaintiffs pre- and post- judgment interest;

(x) ordering defendants, jointly and severally, to acknowledge plaintiffs as authors and creators of the “rigamortus” sound recordings and underlying compositions, and all derivative works which have been released or authorized and will be released or authorized, indirectly or directly, by defendants;

(xi) ordering defendants publicly to acknowledge the infringement and apologize to reed, jones, and the other musicians who made possible their success;

(xii) for such further relief and remedies the court may deem just and proper.
jury trial demandedplaintiffs hereby request a trial by jury on each claim for relief alleged in the complaint.

[verse 1]
it's to my real ill niggas, heavyweight hitters
dough-getters, fifty ways to make figures
my niggas that come on the spot to feel sisters
like they hear real spitters and kids on the zigga-ziggas
when it's ugly, then the club is lovely
thugs be sippin' hennessey and bubbly
to my comrades that keep it flamin' hot
on dangerous blocks, claimin' spots
where the goal is to be one of the top-ranked soldiers
forty-five holders, one of the high rollers
get respect in the hood, credit is good
knock it down lumberjack style, baby; extra wood
rock it all night long, the bang-a-thon, baby
keep hangin' on, we like it with the lights on
don't have to blow twenty thou' to get to know honey's style
show her the town, steal her heart, no money down

[verse 2]
how about some hardcore? yeah, we like it raw for sure
broads on the floor, wall to wall
there's more at the door, players ball to score
‘cause this right here is for all of y'all
rakim and premo; yo, i got what you need, bro
you go see a show, smokin' el niño
and dj's play hits with hard bass kicks
and then they display tricks like the matrix
make the record fly, undetected by the naked eye
so just feel the vibe, ‘cause your ears never lie
nowadays dj's bags of tricks, graphic
on some behind-the-back shit, catch it and scratch it
blast it, this kid got his craft mastered
hands is mad quick like he mix with magic
spin it back and forth and grab it
and know just where it is… there it is

[verse 3]
to my elite peeps with the murderous mystiques
i hit the streets with beats and they critique for weeks
they be like: ""how that kid ra reach the peak?""
pull out the heat and use my technique to speak
it's dangerous, sit calm and explain to kids
what part of the game this is in foreign languages
they hold ra's events in different continents
put my lyrical contents in monuments
in ghetto garments, i rock a towel like a pharaoh
mind travel, design style like apparel
my fashions last long as a lifetime
‘cause i can see the future when the god write rhymes
they're mad ‘cause i managed to reign so long
like their chance to get money done came and gone
this is strictly for my listeners on the corners at night
and the sisters that be keepin' us right, when i be on the mic

[chorus]
hardcore, real ill niggas
i'm internationally known when i be on the mic

double x-l fresh
now i'm headed for the cover of the motherfucking high times
pregame before a headline, but it's bedtime for all of these kids
off that wax, niggas know what it is
she hopped out that cab, just to hop on the dab
and i'm grabbing the torch and she grabbing my dick
let us smoke

[hook: futuristic]

let your uncle get a drag of that
and puff, puff give, man, i need it for my cataracts
old nigga, cold nigga, bold enough to hit the dab
and yabba dabba, scooby snacking
and little niggas doobie cracking
i'll be blowing til' the day that croak
i got nothing else to do, so i guess i'll smoke

smoking forever and that ain't no joke
i ain't even really mean to impede, y'all got all the bad bitches and all the best weed, catch these keys, she my speed
i'm 'bout to go get it, nigga, it's og

voices in my head, tellin' me, ""nigga, that's fucked up!""

livin' up in the deuce and i can still get shot

trippin' off the four ounce, the four to the fuckin' ounce
to the bounce, every gat, but i'mma still put some work in
wearin' black in the deuce, a nigga lurkin', full of juice
bought from the wretched, the x-raided, settin' 'em flex
waited, that nigga had to murder before he made it
now he's doin' 30 to death row
he said he always wanted the devil to have his soul
young nigga, i wish i coulda told him what was up
fuckin' with the so-called devil will get you fucked
i woulda told him, that nigga, he killin' the bitches all the time
but never knew that nigga would murder and try to ditch a crime
i never knew, i heard of a nigga that snitched, but now the sign
is every fool that deals with the devil is through
me, i'm a psycho, me mama might go ill when she find out
her baby's makin' criminals, that nigga, that mic' man critical
that nigga that lynched, that critical criminal hinges on the loose
so whoever i knocked, you think i'm down, i got the juice
now all i need is a motherfuccin' glock, d
up in the block and in the creek, livin' 24 deep

half-lit, lookin' for a glock, so i stop
by the phone it's ringin' and i wanted a gat
it's x-raided, he made it to the hood, nigga, where you at?
that nigga said, ""'round the corner at the pay phone""
""i got the dank, i got the crew and the nine, loc, you know it's on""
let it be known, i'm a motherfuckin' psycho from the deuce
and all my other niggas got the same juice
but when it comes to trustin' niggas, i can't fade it
frontin' niggas like a game, so i played it
half-dead fools got me gang-related
a new nigga wanna kill me every day, shit
for every nigga that pull a glock on me
i'm not dyin', nigga, that's not gon' be

‘cause once i blow, they know that i'll be the man
all because i'm the lead singer of my band

[verse 1: eminem]
so i get off stage, right? drop the mic
walk up to these hot chicks and i'm all like
""sup, ladies? my name's slim shady
i'm the lead singer of d12, baby""
they're all like, ""oh my god, it's him
becky, oh my fucking god, it's eminem
i swear to fucking god, dude, you fucking rock
please, marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
and by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
especially when i drop the beat and do my a capellas
all the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
so, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
but when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
‘cause they're back on stage the next night with me
dude, i just think you're trying to steal the light from me
yesterday, kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
‘cause i told him jessica alba's my wife-to-be
this rock star shit is the life for me
and all the other guys just despise me, because these

smash these vocals and do a performance
but we in the van and he in a tour bus
you don't want my autograph, you's a liar
and no, i'm swift (oh, i thought you were kuniva)
and what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
‘cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
see, i know how to rap, it's simple, but
all i did was read a russell simmons book
so i'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back

[verse 3: kuniva, kon artis, & eminem]
look at em's little punk ass, thinking he the shit
yeah, i know, man, by himself, taking all the flicks
hey, i thought we had an interview with dj clue?

and our mics are screwed up! and his always sound best
you know what, man? i'ma say something
ayo em! you got somethin' to say? man, nothing

they say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
i'm gon' let the world know that proof is hot
i should cut his mic off when the music starts
(ayo, it's—) ready to snap on a dumbass fan
every time i hear, ""hey, dude, i love your band!""
we ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
so why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
and these guys acting funny every area code
proof, carry my bag! bitch, carry your own
can't make it to the stage, security in my way
who the fuck are you? where's obie and dre?

[verse 5: bizarre]
god damn it, i'm sick of this group (fuck eminem)
time for me to go solo and make some loot (yeah)
i told you i made the beats and wrote all the raps
till kon artis slipped me some crack
""lose yourself"" video, i was in the back
""superman"" video, i was in the back
for the media, i got some suggestions
fuck marshall, ask us some questions
like, ""who is d12?"" ""how we get started?""
(but what about eminem?) bitch, are you retarded?
anyway, i'm the popularest guy in the group
big-ass stomach, bitches think i'm cute (hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
did two and a half and couldn't get up
fuck d12, i'm outta this band
i'm 'bout to start a group with the real roxanne

girl, why can't you see you're the only one for me?
and it just tears my ass apart
to know that you don't know my name

but they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (fuck marshall)

bitch named crystal, let her suck my pistol
she open up her mouth and then i blow her brains out
you ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
the feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'

i'm just doing me and you could never understand it
chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
blowin' purple clouds, nigga i'm so sky high
i ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
out of this world though, i'm so sci-fi
and i don't sit still, i keep it moving like a drive-by
i just tell the truth and so i'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and i ain't ever met a good cop
me and wayne lean like kareem doin' hook shots
cover me, i'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop

cost a few hundred bands and i'm motherfuckin' in it
no need for a room, yeah you know i'm fuckin' in it

she said ""i can't feel my legs"", i'm like ""bitch, me neither""
i'm goin' in, where should i begin?
i don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
and i'ma be a legend even when my life end
and i'ma be a legend even when this night ends
yeah i do my thang, hop up out it like bem!

There's Alot Going On,VIC MENSA,hiphop,"

[intro]
yeah, this just my life
front to back, top to bottom

[bridge]
everything's changing around me
these days don't feel the same
we all lost faith and lost family
why must we play this game?
lord have mercy on me
i've been a sinning man
pull out my wings, jump off the bridge
and crash in a plane, if i never land

[hook]
know i never die
we live forever in my mind
and i sanctify
we live forever, still alive

[verse]
there's a lot going on, but i stick to the ones i love
i never claimed to be a perfect man, but name a great man who was
consequences of my actions in the past years had me stressing out
it was like, may, i just moved to l.a., i was tryna figure it out
medication for depression that i cut cold turkey, had the kid manic
in an episode out in hollywood, wilding out like nick cannon
railing adderall pills out a dollar bill, on the bathroom floor
clean the whole mess up with my nose
what the fuck i need a vacuum for?
new york city on my birthday, june 6th, 2014
i had that first meeting with hov, plus, i brought out the whole team
i drank that whole bottle of d'usse ty ty gave me that night
when we left the club at the rap genius house
me and shawty got into a fight
she came out the room swinging, hit me in the jaw
i was really tryna fend her off
but i ended up in the closet with my hands around her neck
i was tripping, dawg
too proud to apologize or empathize, i blamed it all on her
saying that she hit me first, even though she was the one hurt
i was really just reflecting all the hurt
that i was feeling from the band's rejection
when kids these days split, that shit felt like a c-section
and my infidelity and jealousy with natalie
on top of the amphetamines and the ecstasy
had me tryna drown face-down in the chesapeake
the next month i dropped ""down on my luck"" and had europe going nuts
but i couldn't even appreciate it at the time
i was going through too much
now i had to leverage million dollar label deals on the table for my records
in ibiza eating paella on the roof, tryna choose over breakfast
hov wasn't with the bidding war, but i knew the roc just felt right
when i saw kanye at wireless, without t-pain, still a good life
felt so close when mr hudson introduced me to him backstage
he prolly don't even remember that shit, like a bitch off backpage
but at that stage, i was ready to swing for the fence like a batting cage
at the same time, i was winding down a low point in my addict phase
the adderall started wearing off
and i went into a deep writer's block
all over a song that i couldn't finish
that i wrote about signin' to the roc
isn't that ironic? i was feeling so psychotic
with the whole world excited for me and my idol saying i got it
shit got bad out in l.a., so i moved back home to my mom's basement
linked up with smoko and papi beatz and took it back to basics
then i wrote ""rage,"" that was me screaming out through the pain
and ""u mad,"" addressing my relationship with natalie, it was too bad
the violence and the lies slipped suicide into my mental health
i did acid in the studio one day and almost killed myself
as i started to fall apart, certain stars started to align
om'mas came to chicago in january at the perfect time
he said kanye was working on an album
and uzi played him one of our songs
he was tryna fly me out, nigga
it was goin' down like the dow jones
pulled up to westlake, first day i was there, i recorded ""wolves""
i knew i was the one, like neo meeting with the oracle
but i had to get a handle 'fore the door was pulled
crawled out on snl
all the niggas hating on me back home lookin' at me like, ""fml""
a lot of people coming out the wood like, ""let's work,"" tryna network
all the pressure making my head hurt
the molly wouldn't let the meds work
at this time it's like feb. 1st to the 15th, and i'm still addicted
frustrated, writing shit for ye, tryna visualize someone else's vision
then he laid that verse on ""u mad"" and we made the shit the single
ye and hov getting into it over me, tryna do a joint venture
and g.o.o.d. music still fam
but it's that roc boy savemoney life
took the bus out on the road for the traffic tour, did a hundred nights
cleaned out my closet, i got rid of all of my demons
if you learn one thing from my journey, nigga, it's don't stop believing
when this shit got so suffocating, i could barely even keep breathing
wrote my wrongs all in this song, now, i'd like to welcome y'all to my season
nigga, i'm gone

[hook]
know i never die
we live forever in my mind
and i sanctify
we live forever, still alive

The Creator,Pete Rock,hiphop,"

[verse 1]
it's time to dip-dive-dip, you might break a hip
to the sound that's legit, i've come to make a hit
i usually bust scratches with my brother c.l. smooth
but i decided to get wreck on this groove
as i provide the slide, you're goin' on a ride
i know the weather's nice, there's no need to play the outside
guess who's on the flyer, the man of your desire
pete rock and c.l. smooth, all the honey-dips admire
beats are rough and rugged, pete rock is the creator
now i'm bustin' raps while switchin' cross-faders
makin' sure my sound hits from here to grenada
honey gave me skins, man, i told her friends i ate her
but wait up, i save this subject for later
but it's time to get wreck with the creator

[verse 2: pete rock]
i'm addicted like a stoge, not into vogue
(yo, pete, there's a girl on the phone)
tell her to hold 'cause i'm busy kickin' rhymes to the rhythm
fortified with soul 'cause that's what i give 'em
honeys form a line 'cause i always seem to capture
beats made of rupture, rhymes made of rapture
far from illiterate, always seem to get a hit
if you try to step to this, don't even consider it
skins when i want 'em, but, only when i need 'em
to set the record straight, i'll be damned if eat 'em
call me pete rock, i make the girls flock
and if you want a beat like this, i got 'em in stock
so, flow with the flow, because you know i'm good to go
as i proceed to get wreck on your stereo
not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
but it's time to get wreck with the creator

now, c.l. smooth, cut it up like this
(scratching *right to left*)

[verse 3]
now, i'mma take a try and get a piece of the pie
if they give me one sec to get some wreck
never filled with anger, a good body banger
if you try to step to this, you'll get hung on my hanger
before i say good-bye, suckers gave a good try
but point-blank, you just can't see this
my word is beneficial, pete rock is the issue
and i know you know my style is official
i might give a scratch (yes, cousin)
or i might kick a verse (no question)
either one, i can't be seen, honeys call me tall and lean
and if you want to stick around, i'll show you what i mean
not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
but it's time to get wreck with the creator

it's time to get wreck with the creator
get wreck with the creator

than to be in the pen sharin' showers
tony told us this world was ours
and the bible told us every girl was sour
don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
call me mr. carter or mr. lawn mower
boy, i got so many bitches, like i'm mike lowrey
even gwen stefani said she couldn't doubt me
motherfucker, i say ""life ain't shit without me""
chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
i do what i do, and you do what you can do about it
bitch, i can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
they don't see me but they hear me
they don't feel me but they fear me
i'm illy, c3, 3 peat

Smooth Operator,Big Daddy Kane,hiphop,"

[verse 1]
well excuse me, take a few minutes, to mellow out
big daddy kane is on the mic and i'mma tell about
a minimum length, of rhymes of strength
and power, so listen to the man of the hour
flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
sing ho, swing low, then yo the show
will go on, as i perform
transformin on stage like a decepticon
but i'm not animated like a cartoon
i'm for real, shootin lyrics like a harpoon
across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators
so let's groove with the smooth operator

[hook]
""cause i'm so smooth...""

the b-i-g, d-a-double-d-y-k-a-n-e
i'm good and plenty, servin many and any
competition, wishin' for an expedition
i'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen
rappers act so wild, and love to profile
frontin hard but ain't got no style
i give nightmares to those who compete
freddy kreuger, walkin' on kane street
confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
destruction from the exterminator
but in a calm manner, cause i'm a smooth operator

[hook]
""cause i'm so smooth...""

[verse 2]
now girls step up to this
one simple kiss, and it's over, miss
sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
so just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling
cause it's a big daddy thing
and i'm lovin em right, word is bond
so just play marvin gaye and let's get it on
i make it real good like dr. feelgood
to make sure that my point is understood
that when it comes to this there's none greater
sincerely yours... the smooth operator

[hook]
""cause i'm so smooth...""

[verse 3]
now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
sayin' i'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
the smooth way i say 'em and the way i display 'em
to make them sound different in a way that's gifted
and hey i'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine
and i make one line, bright as the sunshine
attack you like robitussin on a cough
if you know like i know -- step off
competition, i'mma get rid of
you can't get a bit of, so just consider
a break or rest, vacation, hibernation
and make way for my smooth operation
i'm a smooth operator

[hook]
""cause i'm so smooth...""

ahhhhh yeahhh, and you don't stop
genuine for '89
and i still ain't half-steppin, peace!

Poetic Justice,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,"

[produced by scoop deville & sounwave]

[intro: kendrick lamar]
every second, every minute
man, i swear that she can get it
say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
hands up high, hands up high
tell 'em dim the lights down right now
put me in the mood
i'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

[verse 1: kendrick lamar]
i recognize your fragrance
hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
uh, and i know your taste is
a little bit, hmm, high maintenance
uh, everybody else basic
you live life on an everyday basis
with poetic justice, poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
would you trust it?
i mean, i write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
better yet, where your friends and 'em?
i really wanna know you all
i really wanna show you off
fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
cold nights when you curse this name
you called up your girlfriends
and y'all curled in that little bitty range
i heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
nigga, don't approach her with that atari
nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
they say conversation rule a nation, i can tell
but i could never right my wrongs
'less i write it down for real, p.s

[chorus: kendrick lamar]
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just
know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just
know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[verse 2: drake]
i really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
with all these seductive photographs
and all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
young east african girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
i was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
take you and your momma to the motherland
i could do it, maybe one day
when you figure out you're gonna need someone
when you figure out it's alright here in the city
and you don't run from where we come from
that sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
you were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
i mean, i write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
your natural hair and your soft skin
and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
good god, what you doin' that walk for?
when i see that thing move
i just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
they say communication save relations, i can tell
but i can never right my wrongs
unless i write 'em down for real, p.s

[chorus: kendrick lamar]
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just
know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just
know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[verse 3: kendrick lamar]
every time i write these words they become a taboo
makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
i'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
would you trust it? i mean, you need to hear this
love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
call me crazy, we can both be insane
a fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
i mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
and i can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
i want that interference, it's coherent, i can hear it
uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, p.s

[chorus: kendrick lamar]
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just
know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song

Real Friends,Kanye West,hiphop,"

[verse 1: kanye west]
real friends, how many of us?
how many of us, how many jealous? real friends
it's not many of us, we smile at each other
but how many honest? trust issues
switched up the number, i can't be bothered
i cannot blame you for havin' an angle
i ain't got no issues, i'm just doin' my thing
hope you're doin' your thing, too
i'm a deadbeat cousin, i hate family reunions
fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
in town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
who your real friends? we all came from the bottom
i'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
damn i forgot to call her, shit i thought it was thursday
why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
when was the last time i remembered a birthday?
when was the last time i wasn't in a hurry?

[bridge: ty dolla $ign]
tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
even to call your daughter on her facetime
even when we was young i used to make time
now we be way too busy just to make time
even for my...

[chorus: kanye west & ty dolla $ign]
real friends
i guess i get what i deserve, don't i?
word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
i guess i get what i deserve, don't i?
talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[verse 2: kanye west & ty dolla $ign]
i couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (was)
couldn't tell you how old your son is (is)
i got my own jr. on the way, dawg (dawg)
plus i already got one kid (kid)
couldn't tell you much about the fam though
i just showed up for the yams though
maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
merry christmas, then i'm finished, then it's back to business
you wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (shit)
like i ain't got enough pressure to deal with (with)
please don't pressure me with that bill shit (shit)
cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
niggas thinkin' i'm crazy, you defendin' me
it's funny i ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
to be honest, dawg, i ain't feelin' your energy
money turn your kin into an enemy
niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

[verse 3: kanye west & ty dolla $ign]
lookin' for real friends
how many of us? how many of us are real friends
to real friends, 'til the reel end
'til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin (yeah yeah)
to 3 a.m., callin'
how many real friends?
just to ask you a question
just to see how you was feelin'
how many?
for the last you was frontin'
i hate when a nigga text you like, ""what's up, fam? hope you good""
you say, ""i'm good, i'm great,"" the next text they ask you for somethin'
how many?
what's best for your family, immediate or extended
any argument, the media'll extend it
i had a cousin that stole my laptop that i was fuckin' bitches on
paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
real friends
huh?

[chorus: kanye west,  kanye west & ty dolla $ign]
real friends
i guess i get what i deserve, don't i
word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
i guess i get what i deserve, don't i
talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

N.Y. State of Mind,Nas,hiphop,"

[produced by dj premier]

[intro]
yeah, yeah
ayo, black—it's time, word (word, it's time, man)
it's time, man (aight, man, begin)
yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
where fake niggas don't make it back
i don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;

[verse 1]
rappers; i monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm
i be kickin', musician inflictin' composition
of pain, i'm like scarface sniffin' cocaine
holdin' an m16, see, with the pen i'm extreme
now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
i'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and i'll defeat foes
y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
i keep some e&j, sittin' bent up in the stairway
or either on the corner bettin' grants with the cee-lo champs
laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
g-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for houston
once they caught us off-guard, the mac-10 was in the grass, and
i ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
picked the mac up, told brothers ""back up!"" — the mac spit
lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, i made him back-flip
heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""yo, my shit is stuck!""
tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now i'm in danger
finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
so, now i'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
and it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as i be
(so, what you sayin'?) it's like the game ain't the same
got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
and claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
in broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, mac's in fact
same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
in black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
so hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
i know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
and if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
but yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
it drops deep as it does in my breath
i never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
i think of crime when i'm in a new york state of mind

[chorus]
new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind

[verse 2]
be havin' dreams that i'm a gangsta, drinkin' moëts, holdin' tec's
makin' sure the cash came correct, then i stepped
investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
but just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
i ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
give me a smith & wesson, i'll have niggas undressin'
thinkin' of cash flow, buddha and shelter
whenever frustrated, i'ma hijack delta
in the pj's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
full of black rats trapped, plus the island is packed
from what i hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
black, i'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
the fiends fight to get crack, i just max, i dream i can sit back
and lamp like capone, with drug scripts sewn
or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
i got so many rhymes, i don't think i'm too sane
life is parallel to hell, but i must maintain
and be prosperous, though we live dangerous
cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
it's only right that i was born to use mics
and the stuff that i write is even tougher than dykes
i'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
my rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
the smooth criminal on beat breaks
never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
the city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
that's where i learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
i'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of buddha and bitches with beepers
in the streets i can greet ya, about blunts i teach ya
inhale deep like the words of my breath
i never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
i lay puzzled as i backtrack to earlier times
nothing's equivalent to the new york state of mind

new york state of mind
new york state of mind

i boasted, and roasted, and coasted to the pinnacle
because of what i do with a pen
it's vernacular precision
connect the two lines and it's division
plus, when i add lutes and flutes
it's guaranteed to sell like prostitutes
i never had love for hoes who put it blunt
and want me in the back, but, bitch, i'm in the front!
don't front, and really i don't need a reply
pull yourself together as you pass me by
i'm on a whole another level, them hoes is left

i was in that cell, he told me that i’m gifted
i don't make it in the booth, then i'ma make it in the kitchen
i’m special with the mic, special with the whippin'
i ran out of money, had to pay attention
all the people that was 'round me, they ain't have my best interest
you ain't have my best interest
you lazy with yo' loyalty and yo' position
and now i gotta execute 'cause you don’t listen
that throwaway on me dumpin’ with precision
i know shawty only on my trail 'cause she see a ticket
i’m readin' between the lines and peepin' they intentions
can't have you niggas around me, shit gon’ go to missing
i had to press that bump, i had to feel it
you know if it ever come down to it, a nigga with it
all these drugs got the whole world jiggy
hoes comin' out they clothes and niggas trippin'
why hit the top to go back to the bottom?
all these bitches fallin' for me like it's autumn
i'm tryna tell you, homie, you don't want none
they freed me so i'm right back to that mon-yun
somebody tell these niggas they don't want none
kodak black but i'm spreadin' blue hundons
they sent my nigga cool on the fuckin' run
when they let him out of prison, i'll be 31
i knew i was a star when i was sellin' hard
everybody told me i would make it when i was on the block
see, before this rap shit, i was jackin' cars
i couldn't get all my time 'cause i was doin' fraud
me and my nigga lil' marcus tearin' up the wyatt
it hurt me to my heart, heard they gave him 25

pacman, how in the fuck you think we gon' do that, man?
ridin' round old national on 18's without no gat, man
i'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
me and my nigga we roll together like batman and robin
we prayed together through hard times, swung hard when it was fitting
but now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
in volkswagens and bonnevilles, chevrolets and coupe de villes

lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
and beauty parlors and baby ballers
and bowling ball impalas and street scholars
majoring in culinary arts, you know, how to work bread
cheese, and dough from scratch, but see the catch is you can get caught
know what ya selling, what you bought so cut that big talk
let's walk to the bridge, meet me halfway
now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
it's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
it's lookin' bad, need some hope like the words 'maybe'
'if', or 'probably', more than a hobby
when my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
i'm sorry y'all, i often drift, i'm talking gift
so when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
of course you know i feel like the bearer of bad news
don't want to be it but it's needed, so what have you?
now question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
is every nigga with golds for the fall? naw
so don't get caught up in appearance
it's outkast, aquemini, another black experience

i love it, though
i love it, though, huh, you know?

[chorus: kanye west]
uh, put your hands to the constellations
the way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
i know i'm preachin' to the congregation
we love jesus, but you done learned a lot from satan
i mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
we ain't married, but tonight i need some consummation

[verse 1: kanye west]
may the lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
in that magic hour, i seen good christians
make brash decisions, oh, she do it
what happened to religion? oh, she lose it
she putting on her makeup, she casually allure
text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
how she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
i thought i was the asshole, i guess it's rubbin' off
hood phenomenon, the lebron of rhyme
hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
i'm looking at her like, ""this what you really wanted, huh?""
why we argue anyway? oh, i forgot, it's summertime

[chorus: kanye west]
put your hands to the constellations
the way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
i know i'm preachin' to the congregation
we love jesus, but she done learned a lot from satan
satan, satan, satan
i mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
we ain't married, but tonight i need some consummation

[verse 2: kanye west]
when the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
and outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
you got green on your mind, i can see it in your eyes
why you standing there with your face screwed up?
don't leave while you're hot, that's how mase screwed up
throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
maybe i should call mase so he could pray for us
i hit the jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
i ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
you see, i always loved that sense of humor
but tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
the lyor cohen of dior homme
that's ""dior homme,"" not ""dior, homie""
the crib scarface, could it be more tony?
you love me for me, could you be more phony?

[chorus: kanye west]
put your hands to the constellations
the way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
cat got your tongue?

[instrumental interlude: mike dean guitar solo]

[verse 3: rick ross]
lookin' at my bitch, i bet she give your ass a bone
lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
double-headed monster with a mind of his own
cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
all-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
i never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
had cyphers with yeezy before his mouth wired (uh)
before his jaw shattered, climbing up the lord's ladder
we still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
hater talkin' never made me mad
never that, not when i'm in my favorite paper tag
therefore, g4s at the clearport
when it come to tools, fool, i'm a pep boy
when it came to dope, i was quick to export
never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
new mercedes sedan, the lex' sport
so many cars, dmv thought it was mail fraud
different traps i was gettin' mail from
polk county, jacksonville, right in melbourne
whole clique appetites had tapeworms
spinnin' teddy pendergrass vinyl as my j burns
i shed a tear before the night's over
god bless the man i put this ice over (uh)
getting 2pac money twice over
still a real nigga, red coogi sweater, dice-roller
i'm makin' love to the angel of death
catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (uh)

They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.),Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,hiphop,"

[produced by pete rock]

[intro]
(i reminisce, i reminisce)
(i reminisce, i reminisce)
(i reminisce, i reminisce)
i reminisce, i reminisce
uh! (i reminisce, i reminisce)
yeah (i reminisce, i reminisce)
(i reminisce, i reminisce)
(i reminisce, i reminisce)

[verse 1: c.l. smooth]
i reminisce for a spell, or shall i say think back
twenty-two years ago to keep it on track
the birth of a child on the 8th of october
a toast, but my granddaddy came sober
countin' all the fingers and the toes
now i suppose you hope the little black boy grows
huh, eighteen years younger than my mama
but i rarely got beatings 'cause the girl loved drama
in single parenthood, there i stood
by the time she was 21, had another one
this one's a girl, let's name her pam
same father as the first, but you don't give a damn
irresponsible, plain not-thinking
papa said chill but the brother keep winking
still he won't down you or tear out your hide
on your side while the baby maker slide
but mama got wise to the game
the youngest of five kids, hon here it is
after 10 years without no spouse
momma's gettin married and a house
listen, positive over negative for the women and master
mother queen's rising a chapter
déjà vu, tell you what i'm gonna do
when they reminisce over you, my god

[bridge 1: pete rock]
my god
it's so
yeah, so lovely
that's how we like to do it in the 90's
pete rock & cl smooth comin' atcha

[verse 2: c.l. smooth]
when i date back i recall a man off the family tree
my right hand poppa doc i see
took me from a boy to a man so i always had a father
when my biological didn't bother
taking care of this, so who am i to bicker
not a bad ticker but i'm clocking pop's liver
but you can never say that his life is through
five kids at 21 believe he got a right too
here we go while i check the scene
with the portuguese lover at the age of 14
the same age, front page, no fuss
but i bet you all your dough they live longer than us
never been senile, that's where you're wrong
but give the man a taste and he's gone
noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
i can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
i get the pillow and hope i don't wake him
for this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
i said pop maybe when you're older
we laughed all night about the hookers at the party
my old man standing, yelling ""good god almighty""
use your condom, take sips of the brew
when they reminisce over you, for real

[bridge 2: pete rock]
for real, baby
like that
we for real
comin' atcha
in '92
pete rock & cl smooth
yeah, c'mon, hit me!

[verse 3: c.l. smooth]
i reminisce so you never forget this
the days of way-back, so many bear witness the fitness
take the first letter out of each word in this joint
listen close as i prove my point
t to the r the o-y, how did you and i meet?
in front of big lou's, fighting in the street
but only you saw what took many time to see
i dedicate this to you for believing in me
rain or shine, yes, in any weather
my grandmom pam holds the family together
my uncle doc's the greatest, better yet the latest
if we're talking about a car, uncle sterling got the latest
i strive to be live 'cause i got no choice
and run my own business like my aunt joyce
so pete rock hit me, 'nough respect due
when they reminisce over you, listen

[outro: pete rock]
listen, just listen
to the funky song as i rock on
and that's word is bond
i'm not playin'
everybody, just coolin'
this song we dedicate
to the one and only
never be another
he was my brother
trouble t-roy
it's like that y'all
and you don't stop
pete rock and cl smooth for '92
and we out, later

it's really all about the money and the power
i just wanna see my people empowered
uh, uh, tell me how we gon’ shape this vision
complainin' all day, but in the same condition
if you wanna make change, it's gon' take commitment

watch me use my prophets, get 'em all to listen
i've been on a mission, ah

until they leave 'em lifeless
another mama cryin', it's another crisis
lord knows we just tryna live righteous
are you willin' just to make the sacrifices?
i know we can't continue livin' like this
and i'll never sell my soul 'cause that's priceless, uh, uh
tell me how we gon' make a livin'
hustle on the block, who gon' save the children?
man it's all a plot and i'm just revealin'
the media just tryna make a villain
i just take the pain and a paint a picture
voices in my head, i hear the whispers
when i feel this way, inhale the swisher
or i sip the liquor, ah

m.A.A.d city,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,"

[part i: produced by sounwave]

[intro: kendrick lamar & schoolboy q]
if pirus and crips all got along
they'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
seem like the whole city go against me
every time i'm in the street, i hear—
yawk! yawk! yawk! yawk!

[chorus: kendrick lamar]
man down, where you from, nigga?
fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
this m.a.a.d city i run, my nigga

[verse 1: kendrick lamar]
brace yourself, i'll take you on a trip down memory lane
this is not a rap on how i'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
this is cul-de-sac and plenty cognac and major pain
not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
it was me, l boog, and yan yan, yg lucky ride down rosecrans
it got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
uh, warriors and conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
with society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
at the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
but ever since that day, i was lookin' at him different
that was back when i was nine, joey packed the nine
pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
pack a van with four guns at a time
with the sliding door, fuck is up?
fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
suck a dick or die or sucker punch
a wall of bullets comin' from ak's, ar's, ""ayy, y'all—duck!""
that's what momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
you killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
now crawl your head in that noose
you wind up dead on the news
ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' bgs up to pre-approve
bodies on top of bodies, ivs on top of ivs
obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
when you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
they say the governor collect all of our taxes, except

it ain't nothin' but a compton thang
g-yeah, how we do

[verse 2: kendrick lamar]
fresh outta school 'cause i was a high school grad'
sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
reality struck, i seen the white car crash
hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
my pops said i needed a job, i thought i believed him
security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
in fact, i got fired, 'cause i was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
i was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
i made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
you know the reasons but still will never know my life
kendrick a.k.a. ""compton's human sacrifice""

[interlude: mc eiht]
g-yeah, cocaine, weed
niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
dip, make a nigga flip
cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
one time's crooked and shit
block a nigga in
alondra, rosecrans, bullis, it's compton

[verse 3: mc eiht]
i'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
shit, the hood took me under, so i follow the rules
but yeah, that's like me, i grew up in the hood where they bang
and niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
pass it to the left so i can smoke on me
a couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
couple of iv's with the fuckin' spray-can
shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
crew i'm finna slay, the street life i crave
shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
mount up, regulators in the whip
down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
trip, we in the hood still
so, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
and a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

[verse 4: kendrick lamar]
if i told you i killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
perceive me to be innocent kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some now and laters to eat?
if i mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
and it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
kill 'em all if they gossip
the children of the corn, they vandalizin' the option
of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
constantly drinkin' and drive
hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
probably go to the projects, i
live inside the belly of the rough, compton, usa
made me an angel on angel dust - what?

[outro]
nigga, pass dot the bottle, damn!

[verse 1: raekwon]
i grew up on the crime side, the new york times side
stayin' alive was no jive
had secondhands, mom's bounced on old man
so then we moved to shaolin land
a young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'lo goose
only way i begin the g off was drug loot
and let's start it like this, son
rollin' with this one and that one
pullin' out gats for fun
but it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
started smokin' woolies at 16
and runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
makin' my way on fire escapes
no question i would speed for cracks and weed
the combination made my eyes bleed
no question i would flow off and try to get the dough all
stickin' up white boys in ball courts
my life got no better, same damn 'lo sweater
times is rough and tough like leather
figured out i went the wrong route
so i got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
catchin' keys from 'cross seas
rollin' in mpv's, every week we made forty g's
yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the tec-9

[verse 2: inspectah deck]
it's been twenty-two long hard years, i'm still strugglin'
survival got me buggin', but i'm alive on arrival
i peep at the shape of the streets
and stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
a man with a dream with plans to make cream
which failed; i went to jail at the age of fifteen
a young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
tryin' to get a clutch at what i could not touch
the court played me short, now i face incarceration
pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
but as the world turned i learned life is hell
livin' in the world no different from a cell
every day i escape from jakes givin' chase
sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
though i don't know why i chose to smoke sess
i guess that's the time when i'm not depressed
but i'm still depressed, and i ask: what's it worth?
ready to give up so i seek the old earth
who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
we got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
and stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
leave it up to me while i be livin' proof
to kick the truth to the young black youth
but shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
and ain't tryin' to hear what i'm kickin' in his ear
neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
that what? that life is hectic

alright, stop (huh?)
now before you walk in the door of this liquor store

go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
and borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(can i borrow this?)
tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
if you shave your legs with renee's razor blades

the whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
think about it before you walk in the door first

can you afford to blow this shit? are you that rich?
why you give a fuck if she dies? are you that bitch?

you's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

[verse 2: snoop doggy dogg]
sure 'nough, i keep my hand on my gun
'cause they got me on the run
now i'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""free 2pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
but at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
so i'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
and put together a million march for some gangsta shit

[verse 3: 2pac]
so now they got us laced
two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
me and snoop about to clown
i'm losin' my religion, i'm vicious on these stool pigeons
you might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
i've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

[verse 4: snoop doggy dogg]
i've got a pit named petey, she nigerina
i've got a house out in the hills right next to chino
and i think i've got a black bimmer
but my dream is to own a fly casino
like bugsy siegel, and do it all legal
and get scooped up by the little homie in the regal
it feels good to you, baby-bubba
you see, this is for the g's and the keys, motherfucker

[verse 5: 2pac]
now follow as we ride
motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the westside
and i can make you famous
niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
i live in fear of a felony
i never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' g's
if you got it, better flaunt it
another warrant, two of america's most wanted

[chorus: daz dillinger & 2pac]
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(nothin' but a gangsta party)
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

[verse 6: 2pac]
now give me fifty feet
defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
and keep whatever's left of me
jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
i bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
there ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
you thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
bow down in the presence of a boss player

[verse 7: snoop doggy dogg]
it's like cuzz, blood, gang-bangin'
everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
you gotta have papers in this world
you might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
you doin' your job every day
and then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
you see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

[verse 8: 2pac]
they tell me not to roll with my glock
so now i got a throw-away
floatin' in the black benz (bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
they wonder how i live with five shots
niggas is hard to kill on my block
schemes for currency and dough-related
affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
no answers to questions, i'm tryin' to get up on it
my nigga dogg wit' me, eternally the most wanted

[chorus: daz dillinger & 2pac]

straight up, shit is real
and any day could be your last in the jungle
get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
the corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
who don't care, guzzling beers
we all stare at the out-of-towners
(aiyyo, yo, who that?) they better break north
before we get the four pounders and take their face off
the streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
the d's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
and killer coppers even come through in helicopters
i drink a little vodka, spark a l and hold a glock for
the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
thinking it can't happen 'til i trap 'em and clap 'em
and leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
i don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
nas is a rebel of the street corner
pulling a tec out the dresser; police got me under pressure

when i dress, it's never nothing less than guess
cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
love committing sins and my friends sell crack
this nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
the school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
so i guzzle my hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
the brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
the type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator

every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
if it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
we was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
nowadays, i need the green in a flash just like the next man
fuck a yard, god, let me see a hundred grand
could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
but if i hit rock bottom, then i'ma be the son of sam
then call the crew to get live too, with swoop
bokeem, my brother jungle, big bo cooks up the blow
mike'll chop it; mayo, you count the profit

and i can't change the way i am
but if i offended you, good
'cause i still don't give a fuck

[verse 1]
i'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' the limo
hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
a lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
fuck a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with this
livin' amuck, never givin' a fuck
give me the keys, i'm drunk, and i've never driven a truck
but i smoke dope in the cab
i'll stab you with the sharpest knife i can grab
come back the next week and re-open your scab (yeah)
a killer instinct runs in the blood
emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
i've calmed down now, i was heavy once into drugs
i could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
my brain's gone, my soul's worn, my spirit is torn
the rest of my body's still bein' operated on

i walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
and cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
i'll hang you 'til you dangle, and chain you with both ankles
and pull you apart from both angles
i wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
and bust open like broken water mains
so tell saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'cause i'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
got your girl on my arm, and i'm armed with a firearm
so big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
buy your mom a shirt with a slim shady iron-on
and the pants to match (""here, momma, try 'em on"")

a brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives

i wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
spent a million a track and went over my budget (oh shit)
now, how in the fuck am i supposed to get out of debt?
i can't rap anymore, i just murdered the alphabet
drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
i'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
i don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
never ran with a clique, i'm a posse
kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
from the second i was born, my momma lost me
i'm a cross between manson, esham and ozzy
i don't know why the fuck i'm here in the first place
my worst day on this earth was my first birthday
retarded? what did that nurse say?

plus, the bombazee got me wide...

breaking all the rules like glass jaws
nigga, you got to get mine to get yours
fucka, we don't need no rap tour
i'd rather kick the facts and catch you with the rap-ture
more than you bargained for
tical, that stays open like an all night store
for real, i keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
and end your existence, m-e-t
ain't no use for resistance, h-o-d

[verse four: redman]
i's be the ultimate rush to any nigga on dust
the egyptian musk used to have me pull mad sluts
i shift like a clutch with the ruck
examine my nuts, i don't stop 'til i get enough
yo shit broke down, light your flair
this the dark side [?] into hollywood squares
6 million ways to die, so i chose
made it 6 million and 1 with your eyes closed
the blindfold, cold, so you can feel the wrath
and shatter the glass and second half on your monkey ass
ayo my man (tical) hear me now
bitches used to play me now they can't forget me now
forget me not, i rock the spot, check glock
empty off a lickin off in hip hop
fuck the billboard, i'm a bullet on my block
how you dope when you paid for your billboard spot?

[chorus: method man & (redman)]

how sick? (so sick that you can suck my dick)

finally, someone let me out of my cage
now, time for me is nothing, 'cause i'm countin' no age
nah, i couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
i'm good at repairs, and i'm under each snare
intangible, bet you didn't think, so i command you to
panoramic view, look, i'll make it all manageable
pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
picture you getting down in a picture tube
like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
mystical? maybe, spiritual hero
who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
priceless to you, because i put you on the hype shit
you like it? gun smokin', righteous with one toke
get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

[verse 2: del]
the essence, the basics, without it, you make it
allow me to make this childlike in nature
rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
i'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
i see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (that's right)
from this fuckin' enterprise, now i'm sucked into your lies
through russel, not his muscles
but percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
that's the inner (fuck 'em) so i'ma stick around with russ and be a mentor
bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
where the thought is, i brought all this
so you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
no squealing and remember that it's all in your head

[chorus: 2d]
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad

i'm useless, but not for long
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

but i still take my time (time)
man, i guess i'm just old fashioned
wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
nigga, see what i'm saying, no closed caption
i paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
i plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
my new girl is on glee and shit
probably making more money than me and shit
i swear to god i got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
i got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
like i got trust issues
i'm sorry for the people i've pushed out
i'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
and still gotta pull out
but that's just me and i ain't perfect
i ain't a saint but i am worth it
if it's one thing, i am worth it
niggas still hating but it ain't working
lil' bitch...

[verse 4: drake]
oh me, oh me, oh my
i think i done fucked too many women from the 305

and that wind won’t guide you

Nas Is Like,Nas,hiphop,"

nas is like; nas is like; nas is like)
umm, premo, nas
yeah, yeah, yo
(nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is;
nas is like)

[verse 1]
freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end
as far as rap go, it's only natural i explain
my plateau, and also, what defines my name
first it was nasty, but times have changed
ask me now, i'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
i spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
saw my close friends shot, flatline, am i sane?
that depends, carry mac-10s to practice my aim
on rooftops, tape cd covers to trees
line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
to the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
to the big dogs living large, taking it light
pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
it's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt
and of course, n-a-s are the letters that spell (nas, nas, nas)

[chorus]
nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (uh)

(nas is like) earth, wind & fire, rims and tires
bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh nas
(nas is like) iron mike, messiah type
before the christ, after the death - the last one left
let my cash invest in stock
came a long way from blasting tecs on blocks
went from seiko to rolex, owning acres
from the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
bet my 9 spit for the pesos
but what's it all worth? can't take it with you under this earth
rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
they just rob your grave, i'd rather be alive and paid
before my number's called, history's made
some'll fall, but i rise, thug or die
making choices that determine my future under the sky
to rob, steal or kill, i'm wondering why
it's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is

[chorus]
nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (c'mon)
no doubt
nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
no doubt (uh)

[verse 3]
(nas is like) sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
i'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
i'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
like greeks in egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
i'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
always got you, i’m like pac, dude you would cry for
i'm like a whole lot of loot, i'm like crisp money
corporate accounts from a rich company
i'm like ecstasy for ladies
i'm like all races combined in one man; like the '99 summer jam
bulletproof hummer man
i'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
i'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
i'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
live it and i write down and i watch it blow up
y'all know what i'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now

[chorus]
nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell

[verse]
yeah, in london talkin' to rhêtorík 'bout my life and shit
i thought the album was finished but i keep writing shit
it's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
no matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
the incredible album, what an incredible outcome
i grip the mic and then talk to the people like i'm malcolm
i used to think the fame and money was the motivation
until i toured the world and met the people face to face and
understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
it ain't about the money and notoriety
it's about the people and making a difference in society
but don't get it twisted, this life i'm living is like a movie
the godfather, the goodfella wielding a uzi
one with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
same level, the same rebel that never settled
pullin' strings like geppetto who overcame the ghetto
and i know you wrote me and i still ain't answered
'cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances
i used to spend all my time conversing with you
but now i write this song to let you know i'm hurting with you
shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street
and even then, that shit is rare—i just don't go outside
'cause honestly i don't fuck with this world, i'd rather hide
that misconception, ""'cause i rap, i must be filled with pride""
shit i ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
people in my ear telling me, ""talk that shit""
actions speak louder than words, i'd rather walk that shit
since the first album, i'm one of the highest earners on the label
within six months i put the second one on they table
i played sold out shows in parts of the world i can't pronounce
release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce
the mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
leave friday for the show and come back monday with a hundred grand
don't fuck with checks, so when i bounce i prefer cash in hand
you know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'cause people don't buy music in this day and age, they buy the brand
there's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when i ain't have shit
felt like i woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
thank god, he never let lucifer close enough to ask
let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
at least i don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne

i got the wild style, always been a foul child
my guns go ""boom boom!"" and yo' guns go ""pow pow""
i'm known to have a hottie open
i keep the shotty smokin'
front, and get half the bones in your body broken
and when it comes to gettin' nookie i'm not a rookie
i got girls that make that chick toni braxton look like whoopi
i run with sturdy cliques
i'm never hittin' dirty chicks
got thirty-five bodies, buddy, don't make it thirty-six
step to this, you're good as gone
word is bond, i leave mics torn when i put it on

and get ends and commit sins with sick friends
'cause i'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
you think you nice as me? haha, you's a funny nigga

i got defensive and said, ""nah, i was the same without it.""

yo, check it
1 for charlie hustle, 2 for steady rock
3 for the forth-coming live future shock
it's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell
8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin' orbit, with the probable 10th
the universe expands length
the body of my text possess extra strength
power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
my ink so hot it burn through the journal
i'm blacker than midnight on broadway and myrtle
hip-hop passed all your tall social hurdles
like the nationwide projects-prison-industry complex
working-class poor, better keep your alarm set
streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
for ch-ching, cats get the ""cha-pow!"" you dead now
killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
it's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
like i got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
but only 15% of profits ever see my pockets
like 69 billion in the last 20 years
spent on national defense, but folks still live in fear
like nearly half of america's largest cities is one-quarter black
that's why they gave ricky ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a key
a 5 minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of americans own a cell phone
so they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
i guess michael jackson was right, you are not alone
rock your hardhat black, 'cause you in the terrordome
full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
crack mothers, crack babies, and aids patients
young bloods can't spell but they could rock you at playstation
this new math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
you want to know how to rhyme, you better learn how to add
it's mathematics

light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
young soldiers trying to earn they next stripe
when the average minimum wage is $5.15
you best believe you've got to find a new grind to get cream
the white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
some front-liners got their gun in your back
bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
and end up in the global jail economy
stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
budget cutbacks but increased police presence
and even if you get out of prison still livin'
join the other 5 million under state supervision
this is business; no faces, just lines and statistics
from your phone, your zip code, to ssi digits
the system break man, child, and women into figures
2 columns for ""who is"" and ""who ain't niggas""
numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
but you push too hard, even numbers got limits
why did one straw break the camel's back?

just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank god
i don't know, but today seems kinda odd
no barking from the dog, no smog
and momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
i got my grub on, but didn't pig out
finally got a call from a girl i wanna dig out
hooked it up for later as i hit the door
thinkin', ""will i live another twenty-four?""
i gotta go 'cause i got me a drop-top
and if i hit the switch, i can make the ass drop
had to stop at a red light
lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
and everything is alright
i got a beep from kim, and she can fuck all night
called up the homies and i'm askin' y'all
""which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
get me on the court and i'm trouble
last week, fucked around and got a triple double
freakin' niggas every way, like mj
i can't believe today was a good day

[verse 2]
drove to the pad and hit the showers
didn't even get no static from the cowards
'cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
saw the police and they rolled right past me
no flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
as i ran the intersection
went to short dog's house, they was watchin' yo! mtv raps
what's the haps on the craps?
shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
roll 'em in a circle of niggas
and watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door little joe
i picked up the cash flow
then we played bones, and i'm yellin': ""domino!""
plus nobody i know got killed in south central la
today was a good day

[verse 3]
left my nigga's house paid
picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
it's ironic, i had the brew, she had the chronic
the lakers beat the supersonics
i felt on the big fat fanny
pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
and my dick runs deep, so deep
so deep put her ass to sleep
woke her up around one
she didn't hesitate to call ice cube the top gun
drove her to the pad and i'm coastin'
took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
i was glad everything had worked out
dropped her ass off and then chirped out
today was like one of those fly dreams
didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
no helicopter lookin' for a murder
two in the morning, got the fatburger
even saw the lights of the goodyear blimp
and it read ""ice cube's a pimp"" (yeah)
drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
today i didn't even have to use my ak
i gotta say, it was a good day

put that shit on my life

[verse 2]
give me a reason to snap
i put this scene on the map
i know the niggas who been talkin' down
but whenever they see me, the first ones to dap
look at my record, nigga (flawless)
i can't respect you niggas
i am the golden child, they gettin' older now
it would make sense why you boys get no recognition
they want me dead or alive
someone tell mom i won't see 25
mean, i can tell her but i just do not want to be there to witness the tears in her eyes
'cuzzi been back on the road
'cuzzi still stuck in the cold
i've been second guessin' like there's someone better than me in my city? (wait)

[chorus]
no, no, no! they want me dead or alive
they want me dead or alive, i'm just tryin' to survive
you niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
put that shit on my life
they want me dead or alive
they want me dead or alive, i'm just tryin' to survive
you niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
put that shit on my life

[bridge]
niggas look like virgins
washed up on the tide, that's detergent
hm, i feel like ja' back in '99
niggas see me scream, ""murder""
i walk around and scream, ""murder""
nowadays, everybody getting murdered
the judge asked for the verdict
then he looked at the jury

[chorus]
no, no, no! they want me dead or alive
they want me dead or alive, i'm just tryin' to survive
you niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
put that shit on my life
they want me dead or alive
they want me dead or alive, i'm just tryin' to survive
you niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
put that shit on my life

i think we make a perfect couple, but you think i'm trouble
maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)

think i'ma be chasing a chickenhead, you're on something
your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
and your gucci boots the same color as mine
if you read between the lines you can see that i want you
i betcha i'll have you doing what you said that you won't do

she loves it when i'm in town, hate it when i'm not around
i get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
pictures hitting the ground, just enough to hold us down
i'm sticking and moving, cruising after the third round
just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
i can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
i admit i fell in love with her frame
and to make her feel special i let her call my by my government name
her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain

but anyhow, when in doubt, went on out and bought it
cause i thought it would be jammin'
but examine all the flawsky-wawsky
awfully sad and it's costly, but that's all she
wrote and i hope i never have to float in that boat
up shit's creek, ""it's weak"" is the last quote
that i wanna hear when i'm goin' down

i'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
trying to figure out how and when the fuck i missed moderate
momma often was offering peace offerings
think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again
searching for a big brother, tyler was that
and plus he liked how i rap, the blunted mice in the trap
too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
from honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks

Riding with the King,Eric Clapton,blues,"

i dreamed i had a good job and i got well paid
i blew it all at the penny arcade
a hundred dollars on a kewpie doll
no pretty chick is going to make me crawl

get on a twa to the promised land
every woman, child and man
gets a cadillac and a great big diamond ring
don't you know you're riding with the king?

he's on a mission of mercy to the new frontier
he's going to check us all on out of here
up to that mansion on a hill
where you can get your prescription filled

get on a twa to the promised land
everybody, everybody clap your hands
and don't you doubt, love, the way that he sings
don't you know you're riding with the king?
riding with the king
don't you know you're riding with the king?

a tuxedo and a shiny 335
you can see it in his face, the blues never lie
tonight everybody's getting their angel wings
and don't you know we're riding with the king?

i stepped out of mississippi when i was ten years old
with a suit cut sharp as a razor and a heart made of gold
i had a guitar hanging just about waist high
and i'm going to play this thing until the day i die

don't you know we're riding with the king?
don't you know we're riding with the king?
riding, you're riding with the king
you're riding, you're riding with the king

spending my money, i didn't care

buying bootleg liquor, champagne and wine

so if i ever get my hand on a dollar again
i'm gonna hold on to it till them eagle's grin
nobody knows you when you down and out
in my pocket not one penny
and my friends i haven't any
but if i ever get on my feet again
then i'll meet my long lost friend
it's mighty strange, without a doubt
nobody knows you when you down and out

I Believe,Jonny Lang,blues,"

make up your mind, take me or leave me
i'll be doing fine, with or without you
i'm wasting my time letting you deceive me
the truth is in your eyes, but i deny what i see
time and time again

i let you get back under my skin
i let you break me down again
i let you get close, way too close
but i see through it

you gave me that smile and i gave in
and you knew that i would
time and time again you pulled me in
just to give me up, give me up again

what is a dream if it doesn't come true
i believe i'll find love, but will it be with you?
i never would have thought that such a pretty little face could
offer me so much and take all that i had
well i want it back

i let you get back under my skin
i let you break me down again
i let you get close, way too close

and the wind cries mary
after all the jacks are in their boxes
and the clowns have all gone to bed
you can hear happiness staggering on down the street
footprints dress in red
and the wind whispers mary
a broom is drearily sweeping
up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
somewhere a queen is weeping
somewhere a king has no wife
and the wind it cries mary
the traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
and shine their emptiness down on my bed
the tiny island sags downstream
'cos the life that they lived is dead
and the wind screams mary
will the wind ever remember
the names it has blown in the past
and with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
it whispers, ""no, this will be the last.""
and the wind cries mary

The Price You Gotta Pay featuring Keith Richards,Buddy Guy,blues,"

i had a dream, just the other night
me and my baby was having a fight
it felt so real, but it wasn’t funny
i took my love, and she took my money

but that’s all right, i was only dreaming
but you know what, it got me thinking

you gotta go, for what you know
cause you’re gonna reap just what you sow
cause life don’t always go your way
and that’s the price you gotta pay

i went to the kitchen, i turned on the sink
got a glass of water, and i began to think
this lying and cheating has got to stop
before i lose everything that i got

sometimes i feel so strange
other times i feel so ashamed

you gotta go, for what you know
you’re gonna reap just what you sow
cause life don’t always go your way
and that’s the price you gotta pay

well i tried to kick the habit
i couldn’t do it, i have to have it
i broke her heart, and i broke the rules
i get no sympathy for being a fool

i cried so hard ‘till i nearly drown
and i paid the price for sneaking around

you gotta go, for what you know
you’re gonna reap just what you sow
life don’t always go your way
and that’s the price you gotta pay

they say he got caught in a trap and it snapped
he's not around anymore...

poor johnny

he came home looking cool one day
just wasn't lucky to come out that way
once from the left... then from the right
they took him down, late that night

now everyone in town knew he always played around
but not a word was said
all the money and the clothes
and the cars that he drove just kept his ego fed

to his friends he was king
cause he thought of everything
except his number one

she had the kids and the house
while he was always out
leaving his homework undone

just wasn't lucky to come out that way
once from the left... then from the right

they had to teach him a lesson
they had to make things right

[skit presents on live in county jail, 1971]

ladies. i said ladies! ladies, if you got a man and the man don't do like you think he should... ladies, you don't hurt 'im. i said you don't hurt him! men happens to be god's gift to women! so, ladies, you must know that the man is already grown so you can't raise him over again

so the thing to do is throw your arms around him! hold him close to you! look him straight in the eyes! and then you tell him... you tell him, you say ""now baby you been messing up, but i know you gonna do me better."" and when he look at you as if he wanna know when, then you tell him...""someday baby"". and if it seem like he's hard of hearing or not paying you much attention or something do like you ladies are known to do... put your hands on your hips and then you say it again... ow! he has to be a mighty hard hearted person not to listen to you

but i don't think it's fair to just talk to the ladies, i think i should say a few words to the men too. so, fellas... i said ""fellas""! fellas if you got a woman and the lady don't do like you think she should, don't you be goin' upside of her head now. you know what i'm talkin' about, don't you be beatin' on her. the judgement's much cheaper if you don't beat her. and you see if you hurt her you only do one thing... i said if youhurt her you only do one thing! you make her a little smarter and she won't let you catch her the next time. so the thing to do is throw your arms around the pretty little thing! now listen to me, listen to me... i don't care if she weigh thirty-two and a half pounds wet or five hundred and fifty pounds on her feet. if she's your lady and you dig her, than she's your pretty little thing... and then you tell her! you say ""baby! baby, i don't care what they say about you on the next block, your my little lady and i dig you. let 'em talk, let 'em say what they want to say""

and fellas, you must know too that the ladies, god bless their sweet little souls, ladies happens to be god's gift to man too fellas. you all agreed? you better say it cause your wife is listening. but there's just one more thing i must say to you, fellas. just one more thing. don't be too proud to beg. i said don't be too proud to beg! if you have to fall down on your knees to let your woman know that you love her, go on down there! i can see some of you cats got dirty minds in the place this evening...what i'm tryin' to say, ladies, love to hear their men say ""baby, i love you!"" don't you ladies? i said: ladies! love to hear their men say ""baby, i love you!""
don't you ladies? so fellas tell your lady that you love her! she might think you're lying though. tell your lady that you love her even if you are lying

but seriously speaking, when i goof, when i goof i usually slide up to my woman and i look straight at her... i have to get my look first... i usually say i look like a little puppy begging for that last bone you been holding out on. i look straight at her and i say ""baby! please forgive me, honey!"" and then i wait a few minutes to see how she take it and then i say ""baby! please forgive me, honey!"" and then i stand back far enough so that when she swings, i can duck... and then i say ""baby! you know when i goofed last week, i was high"". if she let me get away with that then i look at her real pitifull like this... say ""baby! honey, you know when you're high, it don't count"". and then i tell her, i say ""if you forgive me, honey, i'm gonna do better"". and if she look at me as if she wanna know when, then i tell her ""someday, baby""

You Know I'm No Good,Amy Winehouse,blues,"

[verse 1]
meet you downstairs, in the bar and hurt
your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
you say ""what did you do with him today?""
and sniffed me out like i was tanqueray
'cause you're my fella, my guy
hand me your stella and fly
by the time i'm out the door
you tear men down like roger moore

[chorus]
i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told you i was trouble
you know that i'm no good

[verse 2]
upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
he's in a place but i can't get joy
thinking on you in the final throes
this is when my buzzer goes
run out to meet you, chips and pita
you say, ""when we married""
'cause you're not bitter
""there'll be none of him no more""
i cried for you on the kitchen floor

[chorus]
i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told you i was trouble
you know that i'm no good

[verse 3]
sweet reunion, jamaica and spain
we're like how we were again
i'm in the tub, you on the seat
lick your lips as i soap my feet
then you notice likkle carpet burn
my stomach drop and my guts churn
you shrug and it's the worst
who truly stuck the knife in first?

[chorus]
i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told you i was trouble
you know that i'm no good
i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told you i was trouble
yeah, you know that i'm no good

Started Out With Nothin,Seasick Steve,blues,"

i can't lose what i never had
you can't take what i ain't got
when i'm happy, you won't make me sad
depending on you all
well i'm not
cause i started out with nothing
and i've still got most of it left
when i'm down i just get up
when i'm down well i stand up
been down many times well you know it's true
haven't had a red dime between me and you
cause i started out with nothing
and i've still got most of it left (x3)
repeatedly while rambling random stuff
cause i started out with nothing
and i've still got most of it left (x3)
and if all fell apart today
i could just walk
get on down the street
i ain't worried where i'm going to sleep
i can always find some food to eat
cause i started out with nothing
and i've still got most of it left (x3)

She's Dynamite,B.B. King,blues,"

met a lot women who could love alright
but nothing like the woman i met this night
she's dynamite, she's dynamite
she knows what to do
and she knows what it's all about

now men don't blame me because i've been around
i don't understand what's she's putting down
she's dynamite, she's dynamite
she knows what to do
and she knows what it's all about

now she don't drink liquor and very little gin
but she'll show you how, you just tell her when
she's dynamite, she's dynamite
she knows what to do
and she knows what it's all about

she's got a peal handled pistol
a knife and a razor too
you can't ever tell her, she'll always tell you
she's dynamite, she's dynamite
she knows what to do
and she knows what it's all about

now you can whip it, whop it
or hang it on the wall
or throw it out the window
she'll pitch herself a ball
she's dynamite, well she's dynamite
she knows what to do
and she knows what it's all about
